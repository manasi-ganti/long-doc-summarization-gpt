The asymmetry of the grating substrate leads to', \"the interest in anchoring phenomena and phenomena in confined nematic liquid crystals has largely been driven by their potential use in liquid crystal display devices . \\n the twisted nematic liquid crystal cell serves as an example . \\n it consists of a nematic liquid crystal confined between two parallel walls , both providing homogeneous planar anchoring but with mutually perpendicular easy directions . in this case \\n the orientation of the nematic director is tuned by the application of an external electric or magnetic field . \\n a precise control of the surface alignment extending over large areas is decisive for the functioning of such devices . \\n most studies have focused on nematic liquid crystals in contact with laterally uniform substrates . on the other hand substrate inhomogeneities \\n arise rather naturally as a result of surface treatments such as rubbing . \\n thus the nematic texture near the surface is in fact non - uniform . \\n this non - uniformity , however , is smeared out beyond a decay length proportional to the periodicity of the surface pattern . \\n very often the thickness of the non - uniform surface layer is considerably smaller than both the wavelength of visible light and the thickness of the nematic cell , i.e. , the distance between the two confining parallel walls \\n . hence optical properties of the nematic liquid crystal confined between such substrates correspond to those resulting from effective , uniform substrates . \\n more recent developments have demonstrated that surfaces patterned with a large periodicity of some micrometers are of considerable interest from a technological point of view ( see , e.g. , ref . \\n @xcite and references therein ) . \\n a new generation of electro - optical devices relies on nematic liquid crystals with patterned orientation of the nematic director over small areas which can be achieved by chemically patterning the confining surfaces . \\n for example , to produce flat - panel displays with wide viewing angles one can use pixels that are divided into sub - pixels , where each sub - pixel is defined by a different orientation of the nematic director , which is induced by the surface structure and subsequently tuned by the electric field . \\n in addition to the technological relevance , nematic liquid crystals in contact with non - uniform substrates provide the opportunity to study basic phenomena such as effective elastic forces between the substrates and phase transitions between various competing nematic textures ( see , e.g. , ref . \\n @xcite and references therein ) .    whereas the influence of homogeneous confining substrates on nematic liquid crystals is now well understood , \\n the phase behavior of nematic liquid crystals in contact with chemically or geometrically patterned substrates is still debated . \\n one might suppose that theoretical calculations based on continuum theories should resolve the properties of nematic liquid crystals in contact with patterned substrates @xcite . \\n however , such calculations are numerically demanding because two- or three - dimensional grids have to be used because of the broken symmetry due to the surface pattern . \\n moreover , it is very challenging to determine metastable states and energy barriers between them which are important for the understanding of bistable nematic devices @xcite . in the present paper \\n we adopt a different strategy which takes the advantage of the finite decay length characterizing the influence of the surface pattern on the nematic liquid crystal in the direction perpendicular to the substrate . \\n we determine first an anchoring energy function and an average surface director orientation of the patterned substrate and obtain an effective free energy for the nematic liquid crystal cell under consideration . \\n we find remarkably good agreement between the phase diagrams of various systems calculated using this effective free energy function on the one hand and the original free energy functional on the other hand . \\n the continuum theory for liquid crystals has its origin dating back to at least the work of oseen @xcite and zocher @xcite . \\n this early version of the continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals played an important role for the further development of the static theory and its more direct formulation by frank @xcite . \\n the frank theory is formulated in terms of the so - called nematic director @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and its possible spatial distortions . \\n the nematic director describes the direction of the locally averaged molecular alignment in liquid crystals . in a nematic liquid crystal \\n the centers of mass of the liquid crystal molecules do not exhibit long - ranged order . \\n the molecules can translate freely while being aligned , on average , parallel to one another and to the nematic director . \\n it is known that if an initially uniform nematic liquid crystal is distorted by external forces , it relaxes back to the uniform state after the disturbing influence is switched off , signaling that the uniform configuration represents a thermodynamically stable state . \\n therefore it is assumed that there is a cost in free energy associated with elastic distortions of the nematic director of the form @xmath2&=&\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_v \\n d^3 r\\\\,\\\\left[k_{11}\\\\left(\\\\nabla\\\\cdot\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\right)^2\\\\right.\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\&+&\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\left.k_{22}(\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\cdot(\\\\nabla \\\\times\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}))^2 + k_{33}(\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\times(\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}))^2\\\\right],\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\ & & \\\\label{eq1}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the volume accessible to the nematic liquid crystal and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are elastic constants associated with splay , twist , and bend distortions , respectively . \\n the elastic constants depend on temperature and are commonly of the order @xmath7 to . sometimes , for example , when the relative values of the elastic constants are unknown or when the resulting euler -

[ fig1 ]  ( c ) and eq . \\n ( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with local homeotropic anchoring and a flat surface with strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath98 ) . \\n the diamonds in ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the two minima of the effective surface energy function @xmath142 . \\n the model parameters and the line code are the same as in fig . \\n , width=302 ]    we now concentrate on the most interesting ( from a practical point of view ) case of strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath86 ) at the upper homogeneous surface . \\n figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) displays the phase diagram for a few values of the blazing parameter @xmath122 and a fixed value of the local homeotropic anchoring strength on the grating surface @xmath130 . for a fixed cell width @xmath129 , asymmetry ( @xmath143 ) leads to a decrease of the groove depth @xmath140 at which there is a first order transition between the han and the h phases , as compared to the nematic liquid crystal cell with the symmetric surface grating ( @xmath144 ) . upon increasing the groove depth \\n @xmath140 the transition line ends at a critical point ( not shown in the figure ) , while it diverges as @xmath145 . \\n the groove depth @xmath146 corresponds to an _ anchoring _ ( or surface ) transition between low tilt and high tilt _ surface _ \\n states which are the homeotropic and planar effective anchoring states , respectively , in the case @xmath144 . \\n the effective free energy method allows one to calculate an energy barrier @xmath147 between the two bistable states , which is _ not _ \\n feasible by the direct numerical minimization of the free energy functional . \\n the results of our calculations are shown in fig . \\n [ fig4 ]  ( b ) . \\n the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the energy barrier . with increasing groove depth @xmath140 the energy barrier decreases and eventually vanishes upon approaching the critical point . \\n the diamonds in fig . \\n [ fig4 ]  ( b ) denote the energy barriers for the abovementioned anchoring transitions of a nematic liquid crystal in contact with a single grating surface . \\n the energy barrier between two bistable states is an important quantity for the design of a zenithally bistable nematic device . \\n too small energy barrier , as compared to @xmath148 , would cause spontaneous switching between the two states because of thermal fluctuations , while enlarging the energy barrier leads to an increase of the power consumption . using the calculated values of @xmath147 ( see fig . \\n [ fig4 ]  ( b ) ) one can estimate the energy barrier in a real nematic liquid crystal cell . \\n for instance , for a cell of area @xmath149 and of width @xmath150 , and taking the typical values @xmath151 and @xmath152 , one obtains @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which seems to be an acceptable value . \\n another important quantity in zenithally bistable nematic devices is the average director orientation at the grating surface in the two degenerate states . \\n the average surface director in the han ( @xmath156 ) and h ( @xmath157 ) states is shown in fig . \\n [ fig5 ] for the same model parameters as in fig . \\n [ fig4 ] and for the values of @xmath140 and @xmath129 corresponding to the coexistence line . \\n the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of @xmath156 and an increase of @xmath158 . for a fixed value of @xmath122 \\n , the difference between the two angles decreases with increasing the groove depth @xmath140 and finally vanishes upon approaching the critical point ( not shown in the figure ) . \\n hence the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the groove depth at which the bistability is observed , which improves optical properties @xcite , and to a decrease of the energy barrier , which lowers the power consumption of a zenithally bistable nematic device . on the other hand , \\n also the difference between the two bistable states decreases which impairs optical properties of such a device . \\n in section [ iiia ] we have discussed phase diagrams in the @xmath159 plane which can be described in terms of the surface free energy given by eq .  . \\n however , it is instructive to consider a more general situation that the surface free energy follows from a truncation of the fourier expansion given in eq .  . \\n to be able to study both symmetric and asymmetric surfaces we assume a natural generalization of eq . \\n , namely @xmath160\\\\,,\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] which reduces to eq .   in the case of a symmetric surface characterized by @xmath161 . \\n the angle @xmath162 that minimizes @xmath163 ( see eq .  ) is a function of @xmath40 and @xmath35 . \\n the derivative @xmath164 is the susceptibility of the system that diverges at the critical thickness @xmath165 and remains finite and positive for @xmath107 . from eq .   the conditions for the critical angle @xmath166 follow as @xmath167 implying that

the thick lines correspond to first order transitions , and black circles mark critical points . \\n when @xmath11 ( defined on the unit circle @xmath170 ) has one minimum and one maximum the phase diagram can be either of type ( a ) or ( b ) . \\n when @xmath11 has two minima and two maxima the phase diagram is of type ( b ) unless the minima are of equal depth , in which case it is of type ( c ) . \\n note that the lines @xmath171 are identified with each other and the phase diagram can be considered as being on a cylindrical surface.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the extremes of @xmath11 given by eq . \\n can be found easily only in the case of symmetric or antisymmetric ( @xmath172 ) surface and the same concerns the position of critical point . in this work , however , we are interested rather in possible topologies of the phase diagram in the @xmath159 plane , which result from eqs . and , and not in the exact location of critical points or transition lines . to draw schematic phase diagrams we consider @xmath11 as a function defined on the unit circle @xmath170 \\n depending on the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath113 has either one minimum and one maximum or two minima and two maxima . \\n this conclusion applies also to the function @xmath173 , thus , there can be either one or two critical points in the phase diagram ( see eqs . and ) . in the limit of large @xmath35 \\n , there is always a first order phase transition between two non - uniform textures corresponding to the opposite orientations of the director at @xmath21 . \\n this is because @xmath174 is not a periodic function of @xmath175 at fixed @xmath40 . to find @xmath40 at the transition we expand @xmath11 around its deepest minimum ( denoted @xmath176 ) , which leads to the approximate free energy : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the extrapolation length . \\n since @xmath176 and @xmath179 are equivalent minima of @xmath11 , and both @xmath176 and @xmath40 are allowed to vary in the interval @xmath180 $ ] , the transition occurs at @xmath181 if @xmath182 or at @xmath183 if @xmath184 . with the above information we can now draw schematically the phase diagram ( see fig .  [ fig : diagram ] ) . \\n since the vertical lines at @xmath171 are to be identified with each other the phase diagram can be considered on a cylindrical surface . \\n away from the transition lines there is a smooth evolution from one texture to another . \\n this means that at fixed @xmath35 it is possible to transform smoothly the @xmath185 texture into the @xmath186 texture , i.e. , without crossing the transition line , even for @xmath187 . \\n we note that in some range of parameters , the phase diagram for @xmath11 with one minimum is topologically indistinguishable from that for @xmath11 with two minima ( fig . \\n [ fig : diagram ]  ( b ) ) ; in both cases there are two critical points and a triple point . \\n if @xmath11 has two equal minima ( e.g. , at @xmath101 and @xmath188 in the case of symmetric surface ) the triple point disappears and the first order transition lines extend to @xmath189 , as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : diagram ]  ( c ) . \\n we have studied the phase behavior of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a flat and a patterned substrate ( fig . \\n [ fig1 ] ) using the frank - oseen model [ eq . \\n ( [ eq4 ] ) ] and the rapini - papoular surface free energy [ eq . \\n ( [ eq5 ] ) ] . an expression for the effective free energy function of the system [ eq . \\n ( [ eq6 ] ) ] was derived by determining an effective surface free energy characterizing the anchoring energy at the patterned surface [ eq .  ( [ eq8 ] ) ] . using the effective free energy function , \\n we have determined the phase behavior of the nematic liquid crystal confined between a flat surface with strong anchoring and a chemically patterned sinusoidal surface ( fig . \\n [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) , finding first order transitions between a homeotropic texture ( h ) and hybrid aligned nematic ( han ) textures ( figs . \\n [ fig2 ] ( b ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) ) . \\n it is possible to have a first order phase transition even with a monostable surface characterized by a monotonic surface free energy function ( fig . \\n [ fig2 ]  ( a ) , @xmath114 $ ] ) . \\n in addition we have performed direct minimizations of the original free energy functional [ eqs . \\n ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) ] on a two - dimensional grid and found remarkably good agreement with the phase boundaries resulting from the effective energy function analysis ( figs \\n .  [ fig2 ] ( b ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) ) . \\n hence quantitatively reliable predictions of the phase behavior can be achieved using the effective free energy method .    using this method , \\n we have also studied the phase behavior ( fig . \\n [ fig : blazed ] ( b ) ) of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a chemically uniform , asymmetrically grooved substrate ( fig . \\n [ fig1 ]  ( c ) and eq . \\n ( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with locally homeotropic anchoring and a flat substrate with strong homeotropic anchoring , which is a typical setup for a zenithally bistable nematic device @xcite . \\n the asymmetry of the grating substrate leads to a decrease of the groove depth at which a first order transition between the h and han phases occurs ( fig . \\n [ fig4 ]  ( a ) ) . \\n moreover , we have determined the energy barrier between the two coexisting states ( fig . \\n [ fig4 ]  ( b ) ) . \\n our calculations show that the energy barrier decreases with increasing the asymmetry of the grating surface but it is well above @xmath190 for a typical nematic liquid crystal cell . \\n in addition , the average director orientation at the grating surface in two bistable states has been calculated ( fig . \\n [ fig5 ] ) . \\n the difference between the two bistable states vanishes with increasing substrate asymmetry , which has a negative effect on the optical properties of a zenithally bistable nematic device . \\n we have also generalized the model of the effective surface free energy considered by parry - jones _ \\n @xcite to the case of asymmetric structured substrates and obtained three possible types of the phase diagram in the plane spanned by the orientation of the director at the homogeneous surface and the thickness of the nematic cell . \\n the asymmetry of the substrate causes only a shift of transition lines and critical points , compared to the symmetric case , but does not change the topology of the phase diagram . \\n finally , we have verified that this model allows one to reproduce qualitatively the phase diagram of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a homogeneous planar substrate and an asymmetrically grooved surface ( fig . \\n [ fig : blazed ]  ( b ) and fig . \\n [ fig : diagram ]  ( b ) ) .\", 'we study the phase behavior of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a flat substrate with strong anchoring and a patterned substrate whose structure and local anchoring strength we vary . by first evaluating an effective surface free energy function characterizing the patterned substrate we derive an expression for the effective free energy of the confined nematic liquid crystal . \\n then we determine phase diagrams involving a homogeneous state in which the nematic director is almost uniform and a hybrid aligned nematic state in which the orientation of the director varies through the cell . \\n direct minimization of the free energy functional were performed in order to test the predictions of the effective free energy method . \\n we find remarkably good agreement between the phase boundaries calculated from the two approaches . \\n in addition the effective energy method allows one to determine the energy barriers between two states in a bistable nematic device .', 316, 7174, 154], [' relation for the b07 and s07 samples is discussed in * ? ? ? * . \\n\\nGalaxy clusters are large groups of galaxies that are the largest peaks in the cosmic density field.

ray emission obtained by stacking and to provide estimates of the scatter in the optical richness  x - ray luminosity relation . \\n the maxbcg catalog has been studied in a variety of complementary ways . \\n for example , both dynamical  ( * ? ? ? * henceforth b07 ) and weak lensing  ( * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * s07 , j07 ) observations of these clusters have been extracted from sdss data . \\n these earlier observations can be combined with the mean @xmath0 measurements presented here to provide further insight into cluster physics . \\n the @xmath0@xmath12 relation inferred for maxbcg clusters is described here , while the corresponding @xmath0@xmath13 relation obtained from weak lensing is discussed in a companion letter  @xcite . \\n an analysis similar to that reported in this paper was performed for the nir selected 2mass cluster catalog by ( * ? ? ? \\n * henceforth dkm07 ) . \\n the 2mass nir flux - limited catalog has @xmath14 nearby ( @xmath15 ) groups and clusters ranging in mass from @xmath16 , selected with a matched - filter algorithm  @xcite . \\n dkm07 are the first to take a large optically - selected cluster catalog and measure the mean ( stacked ) x - ray properties using rass , rather than simply cross - correlating optically - selected and x - ray - selected clusters . \\n they find that the x - ray luminosity of 2mass clusters scales with optical richness ( their @xmath17 , the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath18 within @xmath19 ) . \\n in addition , they derive x - ray temperatures and hydrostatic masses for the stacked 2mass clusters .    in section [ sec : input data ] \\n , we briefly review the sdss data , maxbcg catalog , and rass data on which this study is based . \\n section [ sec : x - ray analysis ] describes our measurement of x - ray luminosities for individual clusters , as well as our methods for determining the mean x - ray luminosity of a set of clusters with similar richness . \\n we describe the mean relation of x - ray luminosity as a function of richness , scatter in this relation , and the underlying median @xmath20 relation in section [ sec : meanrelation ] . \\n section [ sec : biases ] discusses several possible sources of systematic bias in these results . in section [ sec : lsig ] we combine these results with dynamical measurements of maxbcg clusters to produce a measurement of the @xmath21 relation . \\n conclusions and some discussion of future work are presented in section [ sec : summary ] . throughout this work we use a @xmath22cdm cosmology with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . \\n the measurements described here are based on two wide - area imaging surveys ; sdss and rass . \\n galaxy clusters are selected from the sdss five - band imaging data using a red sequence selection method . \\n sdss data also allow measurement of cluster redshifts and richnesses . \\n x - ray emission from these clusters is then measured by from the rass photon maps . in this section \\n we describe briefly the sdss imaging data , galaxy cluster selection and calibration , and rass input data . \\n optical data for this study are drawn from sloan digital sky survey : a combined imaging and spectroscopic survey of 10@xmath25 deg@xmath26 in the north galactic cap and a smaller region in the south . \\n the imaging survey was carried out in drift - scan mode in five sdss filters ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) to a limiting magnitude of @xmath32 @xcite . \\n photometric errors are typically limited at bright magnitudes by systematic uncertainties at the 3% level . \\n the spectroscopic survey targets both a `` main '' sample of galaxies with @xmath33 and a median redshift of @xmath34 @xcite and a `` luminous red galaxy '' sample @xcite which is approximately volume limited out to z=0.38 . for more details of the sdss \\n see @xcite and @xcite . \\n the maxbcg cluster catalog is selected from imaging data contained in dr5 of the sdss . \\n selection of galaxy clusters from this imaging data is done using the `` maxbcg '' algorithm . \\n details of the algorithm are presented in @xcite , while the catalog and a description of its properties may be found in @xcite . in brief , the algorithm exploits two well - known features of rich galaxy clusters in addition to the tight spatial clustering of cluster galaxies . \\n first , the bright end of the cluster luminosity function is dominated by red sequence galaxies with a small dispersion in color - magnitude space ( the e / s0 ridgeline ) . \\n second , clusters contain a distinct brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) located near the center of the galaxy distribution . \\n while some clusters lack an obvious central , dominant galaxy , every cluster does possess some red sequence galaxy brighter than any other . \\n the algorithm measures independently the likelihood that a galaxy is spatially located in an overdensity of e / s0 ridgeline galaxies with similar @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors , and that it has the color and magnitude properties of a typical bcg . \\n both likelihoods are evaluated for every sdss galaxy at a grid of redshifts . \\n the redshift which maximizes the product of these likelihoods is then found for each galaxy . \\n for e / s0 galaxies , this corresponding maximum likelihood redshift then provides a good estimate of the cluster redshift . \\n once this list of cluster center likelihoods is assembled , these potential centers are ranked by decreasing maximum likelihood . the first cluster is seeded on the highest likelihood center , that cluster s bcg . \\n galaxies projected within a scaled radius , @xmath37 , of this bcg and within @xmath38 in @xmath31 are eliminated from the list of potential centers . \\n @xmath37 is the radius interior to which the mean density is 200 times the critical density ( @xmath39 ) as determined from sdss galaxy populations  @xcite . \\n the process is repeated for the next most likely bcg on the list , given that it has not been eliminated by a higher likelihood bcg , and continues likewise until all potential centers have either been labeled as cluster bcgs or have been subsumed by higher likelihood centers . \\n each cluster defined in this way has a center defined as the bcg location , an estimated redshift , and a richness , @xmath6 , given by the number of e / s0 ridgeline members falling within @xmath37 of the bcg and brighter than 0.4 @xmath40 . \\n the final cluster catalog contains an array of measured properties , including photometric redshifts , richnesses , optical luminosities , and locations . \\n the public maxbcg catalog contains a total of 13,823 clusters drawn from approximately 7500 square degrees of sky between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.3 , with a median redshift @xmath41 . \\n the center for each cluster is defined as the location of the bcg identified by the algorithm . \\n the richness of the cluster , @xmath6 , ranges between 10 and 188 in the public catalog , and in principle extends down to @xmath42 where the maxbcg selection function is less well - understood . for this study \\n we include some clusters of lower richness , adding an additional 3532 clusters with @xmath43 . \\n this slightly extended catalog allows us to use the same richness bins studied in the analysis of maxbcg galaxy dynamics  ( b07 ) and gravitational lensing  ( s07 , j07 ) . \\n redshift estimates for the clusters , produced as part of the cluster finding process , have been shown by comparison to spectroscopic redshifts to be quite accurate , with @xmath11 @xcite . \\n catalog completeness and purity have been studied in some detail in @xcite ; both are quite high . \\n completeness is estimated to be @xmath44 for clusters with masses greater than @xmath45 , and purity is @xmath44 for clusters with richnesses @xmath46 .    the cluster population in this catalog has been used to derive constraints on cosmology @xcite using cluster counts . \\n the relationship between the maxbcg richness @xmath6 and mass has been studied through galaxy dynamics  ( b07 ) and weak lensing ( s07 , j07 ) \\n . further work on galaxy populations , mass - to - light ratios , and improved richness estimates for these clusters is in progress . \\n the _ rosat _ all - sky survey  ( rass , * ? ? ? \\n * ) took place primarily during a six - month campaign in 1990 - 1991 to image the whole sky in soft x - rays ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter  ( pspc , * ? ? ? \\n the survey scanned the sky in great circles , with the largest net exposure time ( @xmath47 ) near the ecliptic poles . \\n the typical field coincident with the maxbcg survey region , which does not overlap the northern ecliptic pole , has an effective exposure time of @xmath48 . \\n the point spread function ( psf ) for these rass scans is very broad ( full - width - half - maximum of @xmath49 ) and is dominated by far off - axis photons due to the survey strategy . \\n @xcite released reprocessed photon maps and exposure maps of the entire rass survey region . \\n these photon maps provide the input for the analysis described in this paper . \\n rass data has been used to create several catalogs of purely x - ray selected objects . \\n the rosat bright source catalog  ( bsc , * ? ? ? * ) consists of 18,811 sources with a typical signal - to - noise @xmath50 . \\n the position resolution is superior to the psf fwhm with 68% ( 90% ) of the sources within @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . \\n in addition to the bsc , there is a companion faint source catalog  ( fsc , * ? ? ? * ) consisting of 105,924 sources with a typical signal - to - noise @xmath53 . \\n most are unresolved . \\n combined , these catalogs provide soft x - ray detected sources which can also be compared to the maxbcg clusters .    the rass photon data has also been used as an input for x - ray flux - limited cluster catalogs . the brightest cluster sample  ( bcs , * ? ? ? \\n * ) is a flux - limited sample of the brightest 201 clusters in the northern hemisphere with fluxes @xmath54 . \\n the northern rosat all - sky galaxy cluster survey  ( noras , * ? ? ? \\n * ) is a catalog of 378 extended x - ray sources that have been confirmed to be clusters via optical follow - up . due to the broad rosat psf \\n , this catalog is only @xmath55 complete at their stated flux limit , @xmath56 , which corresponds to a luminosity @xmath57 at our median redshift @xmath41 . @xcite \\n have performed an initial comparison between noras clusters and maxbcg clusters and have found that the maxbcg detects @xmath58 of noras objects . \\n this is consistent with estimates of the completeness from simulations  @xcite . \\n the _ rosat_-eso flux limited x - ray galaxy cluster survey  ( reflex : * ? ? ? \\n * ) is similar to noras in the southern sky , with the same flux limit . \\n this catalog of 447 clusters is over 90% complete due to improvements in rass analysis , although only a small fraction of reflex overlaps the maxbcg survey area . \\n the typical rass exposure time for maxbcg clusters , 400 s , is too short to allow significant detections for individual clusters . \\n the large number of maxbcg clusters , however , allows us to make up for this . \\n for example , there are 7986 clusters with richnesses 9 @xmath59 11 . for these objects , \\n the total rass exposure time is @xmath60 . \\n such a large total exposure allows us to measure the mean x - ray emission from these clusters quite precisely . \\n details of the stacking method are described later in this section , and outlined here . \\n we begin by dividing the clusters into nine richness ( @xmath6 ) bins . to simplify comparison to other maxbcg analyses \\n , we use the same richness bins used in measurements of the mean velocity dispersions  ( b07 ) . \\n the number of clusters in each richness bin is shown in table  [ tab : ncluster ] . \\n cccccc @xmath61 & 92.85 & 0.21 & 1727 & 55 & 55 + @xmath62 & 58.22 & 0.21 & 1469 & 146 & 140 + @xmath63 & 44.67 & 0.21 & 1317 & 207 & 201 + @xmath64 & 35.74 & 0.21 & 1201 & 356 & 339 + @xmath65 & 28.57 & 0.22 & 1102 & 665 & 633 + @xmath66 & 22.70 & 0.22 & 997 & 1128 & 1060 + @xmath67 & 18.91 & 0.23 & 941 & 1141 & 1099 + @xmath68 & 13.88 & 0.23 & 823 & 5651 & \\n 5405 + @xmath69 & 9.80 & 0.23 & 727 & 7986 & 7566 + random & & & 7986 & 7529 +    as we do not have x - ray centers for individual clusters , we treat the bcg selected by the maxbcg algorithm as the center of each cluster and stack on these centers . \\n in @xcite it was shown that most maxbcg - selected bcgs ( @xmath70 ) agree well with the center of x - ray selected clusters , which has also been seen for other optically - selected catalogs  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n possible biases introduced by this assumption are discussed in section  [ sec : centering ] . \\n every source and background photon in the stacked analysis is scaled and weighted to the median redshift of the clusters in the catalog , @xmath71 . with these weighted photon maps \\n we construct stacked images in section  [ sec : images ] , radial profiles in section  [ sec : profiles ] , and spectra and luminosities in section  [ sec : spectra ] . \\n we obtain rass photon data and merged exposure maps from the archives available at the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) . \\n the rass data and exposure maps are distributed in arbitrarily constructed @xmath72 degree fields with significant overlap . nevertheless , since we utilize a large background annulus extending to @xmath73 from the central bcg , a significant fraction ( @xmath74 ) of the maxbcg clusters fall across a field boundary . \\n we have therefore built a tool that extracts all rass photons in a given aperture , from multiple rass fields if necessary , counting only once those photons which appear multiple times in overlap regions . \\n after photon retrieval , the appropriate merged exposure maps ( mex file ) are used to calculate the effective exposure time ( @xmath75 ) at the position of each detected photon .    before stacking \\n we exclude from the list a subset of maxbcg clusters which might bias our x - ray measurements for unphysical reasons . \\n no cut on galactic absorption is required , as the sdss observations are restricted to high galactic latitude . \\n the typical equivalent galactic hydrogen column density is a very low : @xmath76  @xcite for the maxbcg clusters , with a maximum of @xmath77 . \\n although the typical rass exposure time is @xmath78 , there are some fields with significantly less . \\n this makes source and background estimation difficult , while not adding significantly to the signal . for this reason \\n , we reject all clusters with less than 200  s mean exposure time . \\n this removes 4% of the total number of clusters , but less than 1% of the net exposure time . \\n an important possible source of contamination for stacked cluster measurements is the presence of a few extremely bright foreground sources . \\n we would like to reject regions contaminated by these sources . \\n rass images of maxbcg clusters , especially at higher redshift , are often unresolved , making it difficult to remove point sources using extent information , so we proceed as follows . \\n we first identify those rosat bright source catalog ( bsc ) sources in the survey area with count rates higher than that expected for emission from any cluster at redshift beyond 0.1 . \\n this corresponds to a count rate of @xmath79 . \\n there are 179 bsc sources in the maxbcg survey area with rosat soft - band ( 0.1 - 0.5 kev ) or hard - band ( 0.5 - 2.1 kev ) count rates above this limit . of these 179 sources , \\n only 13 are clusters as identified in the _ rosat _ brightest cluster sample  ( bcs , * ? ? ? \\n * ) . of these 13 clusters , \\n only one of these objects is associated with a maxbcg cluster ( abell 2142 , the richest and one of the nearest clusters in the catalog ) . \\n the other high - flux clusters are at redshifts @xmath80 . \\n further visual inspection has confirmed that abell 2142 is the only maxbcg cluster associated with one of these extremely bright sources . for the stacking analysis \\n , we reject all maxbcg clusters ( except for abell 2142 ) within @xmath81 of any of these bright sources , due to possible contamination from non - cluster photons . \\n this removes only 0.6% of the maxbcg catalog . \\n the virgo cluster is another important foreground source . \\n this nearby , x - ray bright cluster dominates the rass emission over a significant region of sky , thus making it difficult to estimate the x - ray emission from background clusters . \\n we therefore reject all clusters that fall within @xmath82 degrees of m86 or m87 . \\n this is a relatively small effect , removing only 0.1% of the maxbcg clusters . \\n table  [ tab : ncluster ] shows the number of clusters in each richness bin before and after the rejections outlined in this section , as well as the mean richness for each bin .    to stack the x - ray measurements of the clusters , rass photons from each cluster \\n must be scaled and appropriately weighted . the projected physical distance to the bcg \\n is calculated for each photon , and this scaled distance is used in image construction and radial profile calculations . each source and background photon \\n is then weighted by a factor of @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the luminosity distance to the cluster and @xmath85 is the luminosity distance to the median cluster redshift @xmath71 . for background estimation \\n we use a fixed annulus with inner ( outer ) radius of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , similar to that used for the noras catalog for individual clusters  @xcite . \\n this background annulus corresponds to a physical distance of @xmath88 at our minimum redshift of @xmath89 and a @xmath90 at our maximum redshift of @xmath91 . \\n we confirm that our results are not sensitive to the exact choice of background annulus . to calculate the weighted count rate ( @xmath92 ) in a given bin ( image , radial , or spectral ) for a cluster at redshift @xmath31 , we follow a procedure similar to @xcite , where @xmath93 , where @xmath75 is the exposure time at the position of each detected photon .    as a simple test of our stacking procedure \\n , we also extract rass photons from a set of positions selected at random from the region covered by the maxbcg catalog . \\n each such random position is associated with a real cluster redshift drawn from the catalog in the @xmath69 bin . \\n the random points are analyzed identically to the real cluster positions . \\n the background - subtracted stacked images are shown in figure  [ fig : imageplots ] . \\n each image has a projected radius of @xmath94 . \\n the images contain photons from the _ rosat _ hard band ( channels 51 - 201 , 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) as this band has the highest signal - to - noise for cluster emission . \\n after background subtraction , the counts were put in @xmath95 bins . for display , each image has been scaled with histogram equalization to show similar background noise levels , as there are two orders of magnitude more clusters in the poorest bin than the richest bin . \\n the contours are drawn @xmath96 and @xmath97 above background level . \\n highly significant x - ray emission is seen in each stack of clusters . \\n by contrast , in a stack of 7,566 random points there is no significant excess , and no sign of emission centered in the stack . \\n it is worth noting that the average count rate in the @xmath69 bin is only @xmath98 , corresponding to a flux @xmath99 . \\n there are a total of @xmath100 in excess of background from @xmath101 clusters ; an average of only 1 source count per cluster . \\n this illustrates the power of the stacking exercise to probe very low count rates , and allows us to use rass to measure very low @xmath5 cluster emission even at a moderate redshift of @xmath102 . \\n figure  [ fig : profiles ] presents the background - subtracted surface - brightness profiles for the stacked x - ray images in each richness bin . \\n the radial profiles have been summed in @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) bins inside ( outside ) @xmath105 . for reference \\n , the dotted lines represent the @xmath106 background level . \\n significant cluster emission is seen in each richness bin . for the richest bins , \\n this extends out beyond @xmath105 . \\n the x - ray surface brightness profiles for the different bins look remarkably similar , except for the normalization which increases strongly with richness and the signal - to - noise which decreases slowly with richness . \\n we fit the surface brightness profiles out to @xmath107 with a standard @xmath108 model , @xmath109 . \\n the best - fit parameters are presented in table  [ tab : betafits ] , and are overplotted with dashed lines in figure  [ fig : profiles ] . \\n the @xmath108 model results in a good fit in all cases . \\n cccc @xmath61 & @xmath110 & @xmath111 & 37.7/72 + @xmath62 & @xmath112 & @xmath113 & 43.2/72 + @xmath63 & @xmath114 & @xmath115 & 36.2/72 + @xmath64 & @xmath116 & @xmath111 & 75.1/72 + @xmath65 & @xmath117 & @xmath118 & 46.3/72 + @xmath66 & @xmath119 & @xmath120 & 88.1/72 + @xmath67 & @xmath121 & @xmath122 & 38.9/72 + @xmath68 & @xmath117 & @xmath118 & 36.2/72 + @xmath69 & @xmath123 & @xmath124 & 63.4/72 +    the core radii , @xmath125 , for these @xmath108 model fits are surprisingly large , ranging from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . \\n these are significantly larger than those typically seen for x - ray clusters  ( @xmath128 , e.g. * ? ? ? \\n the @xmath108 parameters are typical for x - ray clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n there is a slightly significant ( @xmath129 ) trend in @xmath108 with richness , such that the richer clusters tend to have slightly larger values of @xmath108 . \\n this slight trend is in the same sense as has been seen in previous work correlating @xmath108 with cluster mass  @xcite . \\n these @xmath108-model parameters are similar to those measured by dkm07 , in which @xmath108 was not seen to be strongly correlated with richness . \\n these inconclusive results are caused by two effects ; the broad point spread function for rass objects , and the offset distribution between the bcg and the x - ray cluster emission .      to study the effect of the rass psf on the stacked profiles , we test our analysis on bright rosat point sources . \\n these sources were selected from the wga catalog  @xcite , which contains 88,621 well measured point - like sources selected from rosat pspc pointed observations . \\n we take @xmath130 moderately bright ( @xmath131 ) point sources that overlap the sdss dr5 mask . \\n these bright sources are nearby galactic sources as well as agn and quasars at moderate and high redshift , and are also well detected in rass . \\n each point source is randomly assigned a redshift drawn from the maxbcg cluster catalog redshift distribution . \\n we note that a nearby unresolved point source is indistinguishable from a distant unresolved point source . \\n the point sources are then stacked in exactly the manner described for clusters above . \\n figure  [ fig : ptsrc ] shows the radial profile of the stacked point sources ( diamonds ) , which is essentially a measure of the rass psf with the radial scaling calculated for the maxbcg cluster redshifts . while this radial profile is much more sharply peaked than that of the stacked clusters , the broad rosat psf scatters significant x - ray emission to distances @xmath132 \\n ( @xmath133 at @xmath134 ) from the center . \\n this psf smearing implies an effective minimum on the @xmath108-model core radius , as well as creating a possible bias in the calculation of the @xmath108 parameter . \\n we note that @xmath135 of the selected wga point sources are within @xmath136 of maxbcg clusters . \\n excluding the point sources that are neighboring these possibly extended x - ray sources does not significantly alter this result . \\n the stacked , projected surface brightness profile may also be affected by our choice of cluster centers . \\n there are several ways in which the bcg chosen by the maxbcg algorithm might be offset from the x - ray emission from the cluster . \\n dynamically active clusters and clusters in the process of merging can have a significant offset between the x - ray centroid and the bcg . \\n there is also the possibility that the maxbcg algorithm chose an incorrect center ( this is addressed more fully in section  [ sec : centering ] ) . \\n in addition , there may be additional x - ray point sources such as agn that are associated with the clusters . \\n all of these effects result in an effective optical / x - ray offset distribution that may bias the radial profiles . \\n we model the optical / x - ray offset distribution by matching the maxbcg catalog to known x - ray sources . for this exercise , \\n we use the fact that many maxbcg clusters ( @xmath137 ) are associated with individual detections in the rosat bright source and faint source catalogs . \\n most of these bsc and fsc sources have not been previously recognized as associated with clusters , primarily because they are too faint or too distant to be seen as significantly extended in rass . \\n we match the maxbcg clusters to the bsc and fsc catalogs , allowing multiple x - ray sources to match to each cluster . \\n this ensures that we find all x - ray sources associated with each cluster , as well as all possible random matches . \\n we similarly match an equal number of random locations drawn from the maxbcg survey region to the bsc and fsc catalogs . \\n figure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] shows the projected offset distribution from the maxbcg clusters to the bsc and fsc catalogs . \\n the solid ( dashed ) line shows a histogram of maxbcg ( random ) offsets in @xmath103 bins . \\n the dotted line shows the residual distribution after subtracting the random matches from the cluster matches . \\n the subtracted histogram in figure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] shows a large excess of x - ray sources associated with the optical cluster centers . \\n there is a tight core in which the bcg is within @xmath138 of an x - ray source , as well as a long tail extending out to @xmath139 . \\n the x - ray source excess at large radius is likely to be associated with the maxbcg clusters . \\n these sources comprise a mix of merging clusters , clusters with poorly identified centers , and associated point sources such as agn . \\n the subtracted histogram is used as a first - order empirical radial distribution of x - ray sources associated with maxbcg cluster centers . \\n we now estimate the additional effect on the radial profile due to the radial offset distribution of x - ray sources associated with the maxbcg clusters . we take each wga point source from section  [ sec : rasspsf ] and \\n randomly alter its position so that the distribution is offsets is identical to the empirical radial distribution . \\n although we have only measured the offset distribution for the brightest @xmath140 of maxbcg clusters , we assume this is a good proxy for the offset distribution between the x - ray emission and bcgs of all the maxbcg clusters . \\n these offset point sources are run through our stacking analysis . \\n figure  [ fig : ptsrc ] shows the radial profile of the offset point sources after stacking ( circles ) . \\n this radial profile is reasonably well fit with a @xmath108 model , although the fit is poor within @xmath141 . at large radii \\n the radial profile is well fit with @xmath142 . \\n thus , at large radii it is not possible to distinguish between true _ extended _ cluster emission and x - ray _ point _ \\n sources convolved with the observed maxbcg \\n x - ray source offset distribution . \\n this calls into question the utility of the @xmath108 model parameterization for this exercise . \\n the stacked x - ray profile is a convolution of the rosat psf , the centering distribution , and the true extended x - ray emission . \\n operationally , it is not possible to separate the contributions from these three components . \\n therefore , the @xmath108 parameters that are the result of a stacking exercise such as this one , where most of the individual x - ray clusters are not detected , should be used cautiously . \\n we perform spectral fitting of the photons in each stack to calculate x - ray luminosities . \\n the spectra were analyzed using xspec version 11.3.2  @xcite . \\n spectral analysis on the stacked rosat data involves a variety of complications , some of which are discussed in dkm07 . \\n we outline some key issues here . \\n all rass observations integrate exposure time across the _ rosat _ field - of - view . as a result \\n , we use the spectral response file pspcc_gain1_256.rmf from heasarc , suitable for off - axis observations . \\n when combined with the appropriate ancillary response file ( arf ) , we obtain the vignetting corrected spectral response for the off - axis photons that comprise our spectra . \\n however , the exposure times extracted from the merged exposure maps for rass are already corrected for vignetting , using the mean spectrum of the x - ray background in the pspc band . in practice \\n , this means that our spectra , fit with the standard rmf+arf combination , are corrected for vignetting _ \\n twice _  once by using the exposure times obtained from the merged exposure map , and once in the calculation of the arf file . by comparing the on - axis response file rsp from heasarc with the combination of the rmf+arf we can approximate the extra vignetting correction . \\n this correction is a function of energy , and depends ( weakly ) on the spectrum of the observed source . by simulating cluster spectra of various temperatures , \\n we calculate the typical correction factor averaged across the rosat hard band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) which is dominated by cluster flux . \\n this correction factor is @xmath143 . using this correction factor results in very good agreement between our spectral analysis and the reflex count - rate to flux conversion tables of @xcite . \\n we estimate that applying this correction factor to all flux and luminosity values determined from stacked spectra adds an additional systematic error of @xmath144 .    for our analysis \\n , we use the rmf file described above , combined with an arf output with the ftool pcarf . \\n as noted in dkm07 , each arf file is essentially identical , because each stacked cluster from rass samples photons from the entire rosat field of view . \\n spectral files are then grouped with a minimum of 50 counts per bin ( after background subtraction ) to ensure valid results using @xmath145 statistical analysis . \\n fits performed with xspec were restricted to the 0.1 -

to - noise , and because the radial profiles do not appear to change significantly with richness . \\n the @xmath37 value for each bin was taken as the median @xmath37 of all the clusters in the richness bin ; these values are reported in table  [ tab : lxr200 ] . \\n background spectra are stacked with the same weights as the source spectra , using the annuli defined in section  [ sec : extraction ] . \\n as described previously , each photon is weighted to the median redshift @xmath147 . \\n unfortunately , @xmath148-correction of individual photons is not possible , due to the fact that the detection channel of the incident photons is most strongly dominated by the spectral response of the rosat instrument . \\n the stacking procedure will therefore tend to `` smear out '' the incident cluster spectra . \\n simple simulations of x - ray spectra using xspec show that this does not create a large effect on our best - fit spectral values , as our redshift range of @xmath149 is not particularly broad . \\n similarly , we do not make any corrections for possible redshift evolution in x -

frame 0.1 - 2.4  kev band at the median redshift . \\n we prefer to calculate the 0.1 - 2.4  kev luminosity rather than bolometric luminosity ( @xmath202 ) , due to the large extrapolations required to obtain bolometric values , which strongly depend on spectral temperatures ( see below ) . \\n the best - fit spectral parameters for the scaled @xmath37 apertures are shown in table  [ tab : lxr200 ] , and the parameters for the fixed @xmath146 apertures are shown in table  [ tab : lx750 ] .    in order to account properly for the variations in cluster luminosity in each richness bin \\n , we use bootstrap resampling to estimate the luminosity errors . in each richness bin , we run 2000 trials by sampling the same number of clusters in that bin with replacement . to save considerable time with processing , we did not recreate the entire stacking procedure for each resampling . \\n instead , we take the individual cluster counts , scaled to the median redshift . \\n we confirm that the average scaled count rate is a good proxy for luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band ( see section  [ sec : scatter ] for details on this calculation ) . \\n the 68% ( @xmath106 ) confidence interval obtained from the bootstrap is added in quadrature with the @xmath5 errors obtained from the spectral fits . \\n only the richest ( @xmath61 ) bin is dominated by the bootstrap error calculation , due to the large range in richness and @xmath5 in the bin . \\n figure  [ fig : ltplot ] shows the mean @xmath0@xmath203 relation for our stacked clusters ( within the scaled @xmath37 aperture ) , compared to the @xcite @xmath5@xmath204 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) relation . \\n we see the cluster temperature increase with luminosity , but our observed @xmath0@xmath203 relation is noticeably steeper than that of @xcite . \\n the stacked x - ray temperatures appear to underestimate the expected temperature , especially at @xmath0 larger than a few times @xmath205 . \\n this discrepancy highlights the challenge of measuring cluster temperatures with rosat , as well as the challenges of measuring stacked cluster temperatures . \\n first , rosat has sensitivity only to soft x - rays . \\n when the break of the bremsstrahlung spectrum , determined by the temperature of the hot gas , is above @xmath206 , then the x - ray temperature becomes difficult to constrain . \\n the _ rosat \\n _ temperatures of hot clusters are generally underestimated ; a particular example is abell 1689 . \\n this bright cluster has a nearly isothermal profile in _ \\n xmm / newton _ observations with a temperature of @xmath207 ( consistent with the asca and _ chandra _ values ) , but has a best - fit _ rosat_/pspc temperature of @xmath208  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n second , when we stack many non - isothermal clusters with different temperatures , our isothermal raymond - smith spectrum is no longer appropriate . \\n for example , @xcite have shown for _ chandra _ observations how the spectroscopically - weighted temperature can differ significantly from the emission - weighted temperature for single clusters , with the better measured colder gas dominating the spectral fit . \\n when these effects are combined , interpreting the average best - fit spectral temperature from a stack of hundreds of clusters is non - trivial . \\n most importantly for our task of measuring the mean @xmath0 , the rosat luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band is virtually insensitive to the cluster temperature . \\n if we fix the spectral temperature to the value predicted by the @xcite @xmath5@xmath204 relation , then @xmath0 changes by @xmath209 in each bin , with no systematic bias with richness . \\n similarly , we can follow the prescription of @xcite to convert the mean 0.5 - 2.0 kev rass count rate to flux and luminosity . \\n this method assumes the @xcite @xmath5@xmath204 relation , and requires iteratively calculating the flux and temperature . \\n the @xmath0 values thus obtained are consistent with those from the spectral fitting to within @xmath210 . \\n all this suggests that calculating 0.1 - 2.4  kev @xmath5 obtained from _ \\n rosat_which relies primarily on photon counting  is more robust than calculating @xmath204 and extrapolating to @xmath202 . \\n although a small @xmath148-correction ( @xmath144 ) is required to extrapolate from observer frame 0.1 - 2.4  kev to rest - frame luminosity , this correction is not very sensitive to the spectral temperature at the moderate redshift of the maxbcg clusters . \\n we stack the clusters and calculate the 0.1 - 2.4 kev x - ray luminosity as described in the previous section . \\n figure  [ fig : lxn200plot ] shows the mean @xmath0@xmath1 relation , both for a fixed @xmath146 aperture and for the scaled @xmath37 apertures . \\n we find a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with both the fixed and the scaled apertures . in the low richness bins ( @xmath211 ) , the scaled aperture @xmath37 is approximately equal to the fixed @xmath146 aperture , and @xmath0 is approximately the same for both choices of aperture . in the high richness bins , \\n the scaled aperture @xmath37 is significantly larger than @xmath146 , yielding a slightly larger @xmath0 for the scaled apertures . \\n for this reason , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is slightly steeper using scaled apertures . \\n the best - fit mean relationships are :    @xmath212    @xmath213    power law fits are chosen to pivot around @xmath214 to approximately decouple errors in slope and normalization . \\n dkm07 also found that the mean x - ray luminosity of the 2mass clusters scales with optical richness ( @xmath17 ) . a direct comparison between the dkm07 relation and our relation is challenging , due to the different luminosity and richness definitions we employ , but a first - order conversion is possible . \\n first , we convert the dkm07 bolometric luminosities ( their table 2 ) to _ rosat _ 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosities using table 5 of @xcite . ] \\n re - fitting for the @xmath0@xmath17 relation , we find @xmath215.@xmath17 relation does not deviate from a power - law at any richness , unlike the @xmath216@xmath17 relation in figure 10 of dkm07 . \\n ] as the 2mass catalog is not yet public , we can not make a direct comparison of @xmath6 to @xmath17 for individual clusters . \\n futhermore , most of the clusters in the 2mass catalog are at @xmath217 , while the maxbcg catalog covers @xmath218 . at this time , \\n the most we can say is that the slope of the @xmath0richness relation is roughly similar between our work and dkm07 . \\n comparisons to x - ray selected catalogs ( see section  [ sec : xrayselect ] ) as well as prior studies  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) lead us to expect significant scatter in the x - ray luminosity  richness relation for individual clusters . with a large scatter , \\n the mean statistic used to calculate the stacked @xmath0-@xmath1 relation may be significantly biased relative to the median relation . to understand this bias \\n , we first assume that there is a log - normal conditional probability @xmath219 for the x - ray luminosity of a cluster at richness @xmath6 : @xmath220,\\\\ ] ] with constant intrinsic scatter @xmath221 , and mean log luminosity that follows : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the log normalization of @xmath5 at @xmath214 , and @xmath224 is the slope of the @xmath5@xmath6 relation . \\n note that @xmath225 for a log - normal distribution is equivalent to the median ( and geometric mean ) of the distribution . for the duration of this paper \\n , we employ the notation @xmath226 .    at a given richness \\n , we wish to measure the median x - ray luminosity @xmath227 , the peak of the underlying log - normal distribution \\n . however , the stacking exercise we have undertaken is fundamentally a calculation of the _ arithmetic mean _ ( @xmath0 ) at a given @xmath1 . for a log - normal distribution with median @xmath227 and intrinsic scatter @xmath221 , \\n the arithmetic mean is @xmath228 . \\n thus , the stacked normalization is an overestimate of the median of the underlying distribution by a factor of @xmath229 . \\n if the scatter is large , the stacked ( mean ) normalization will be dominated by the most luminous clusters and will be biased high . \\n for example , an @xmath230 scatter indicates a @xmath231 bias .    to constrain this scatter , \\n we begin with measurements of x - ray flux ( and hence @xmath5 ) at the locations of each cluster with @xmath232 . \\n though many of these are low signal - to - noise detections , they can be used to measure scatter . \\n the idl astronomy library tool linmix_err is used to fit @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 with intrinsic scatter @xmath221  @xcite . \\n this tool uses a bayesian approach to linear regression with errors in x and y and is well behaved even when the measurement errors dominate . \\n it also handles non - detections and upper limits in y. monte carlo simulations show that the selected @xmath6 cut provides a large enough richness range to constrain the slope and scatter , and provides larger signal - to - noise than the entire cluster catalog , as over @xmath230 of the 955 clusters with @xmath233 are detected at at least the @xmath106 level . \\n furthermore , the fits are not sensitive to the precise richness cutoff chosen . \\n to calculate the @xmath5 for each of these often marginally - detected clusters , we use a procedure based on the count - rate to flux conversion method from the reflex survey  @xcite . \\n first , we calculate the 0.5 - 2.0 kev ( rosat hard channel ) count rate in a @xmath146 aperture ; the fixed aperture was used because it results in better signal - to - noise than a larger scaled aperture ( where we only see significant signal in the stacked profiles ) . \\n the local background is calculated in a @xmath234 annulus using the sector - rejection method of @xcite .    in reflex the temperature \\n is estimated in an iterative fashion from the luminosity , using the @xmath5@xmath204 relation of @xcite . as most of the maxbcg clusters \\n do not have a significant flux ( or luminosity ) measurement , we can not calculate the individual cluster temperatures in this way . instead \\n , each cluster temperature is approximated by the stacked spectral temperature from the appropriate richness bin , as shown in table  [ tab : lx750 ] . \\n this ensures that our stacked cluster luminosities and individual luminosity estimates are on approximately the same footing . \\n perhaps more importantly , changing the temperature does not change the 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosities significantly  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n for example , for the clusters with @xmath235 detections , if we follow the reflex iterative recipe to convert count rate to @xmath5 , rather than fixing the temperatures at the stacked values , the individual @xmath5 values change by @xmath236 . \\n this is simply another example of how measuring temperatures with rosat is challenging . \\n the 0.5 - 2.0 kev count rate is then converted to 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosity using table 2 from @xcite with the equivalent hydrogen column density at the position of the cluster  @xcite . after converting to luminosity \\n , a @xmath148-correction is applied using equation 4 from @xcite , which is a good approximation of table 3 in @xcite.z\\\\}^{1/2}$ ] . ] \\n the @xmath148-corrections are not very large , at most 10% . \\n we compared our method of calculating @xmath5 for individual clusters to the @xmath5 values obtained in the noras catalog ( see section  [ sec : xrayselect ] for details on the x - ray catalog matching ) . \\n for the matched clusters the values are all consistent within errors with @xmath237 scatter , and a systematic offset of @xmath238 . the primary difference in our calculations \\n is that the noras fluxes were calculated in an aperture obtained via growth curve analysis ( gca ) designed to obtain the best signal - to - noise for each cluster , while we use a fixed physical aperture . \\n therefore , our fixed temperature and aperture provide an unbiased estimate of the cluster flux and luminosity even without _ a priori _ knowledge of extended cluster emission . \\n individual cluster @xmath5 and @xmath6 values are shown in figure [ fig : linmix ] . \\n we use linmix_err to estimate the power - law slope , normalization , and intrinsic scatter of the underlying distribution of the @xmath5@xmath6 relationship for the 955 richest clusters with @xmath239 . \\n the best fit relation is : @xmath240 with an intrinsic scatter @xmath241 . \\n the individual @xmath5 values are calculated within a fixed @xmath146 aperture , and thus this is to be compared to equation  [ eqn : lxn_750 ] . \\n we test the robustness of this result by both splitting the input data into multiple independently fit subsamples and changing the richness threshold slightly . \\n we find that the constraint on the scatter is robust , and the error bar is accurate . \\n possible systematic biases in the constraint on @xmath221 are discussed in section  [ sec : coolcore ] . \\n the scatter - corrected @xmath227@xmath1 relation is shown in figure  [ fig : linmix ] . \\n the luminosities for the individual @xmath106 detections are plotted as solid circles , and the @xmath106 upper limits are plotted as empty circles . the typical error bar for detections \\n is shown in the lower - right corner . \\n contours showing the @xmath242 contours on the best - fit median relation are shown in dark gray , and the dashed ( dotted ) lines show the @xmath243 ( @xmath244 ) scatter constraints . \\n the median relation as constrained by linmix_err has been converted to the equivalent mean relation by multiplying the normalization by @xmath229 , and is shown in light gray . \\n the mean relation agrees well with the individual stacked bins ( squares ) , which are about @xmath231 brighter than the underlying median values . \\n we must emphasize that we are measuring the _ observed _ scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation as is appropriate to our catalog and stacking method . \\n this scatter comes about not only due to intrinsic @xmath5 variations between the clusters ( including different morphologies and merging clusters ) , but is also due to point sources , cooling flows , and the projection of multiple clusters along the line of sight . for the @xmath245 richest clusters ( @xmath246 ) used in this exercise , the chance of projection is very low . \\n we do not have any way to remove point sources or bright cool cores from individual clusters in an unbiased way . \\n operationally , it is not relevant to our measurement whether the scatter is due to intrinsic @xmath5 variations or due to point source and cool - core contamination . to constrain the observed scatter , \\n we need only assume that the underlying distribution is approximately log - normal , which is consistent with our observations . \\n @xcite measure the observed scatter in the @xmath5@xmath247 relation , where @xmath247 is a richness measure from the amplitude of galaxy - cluster correlation function  @xcite . \\n they use 290 optically - selected clusters , of which 40 have significant detections in _ rosat_/pspc observations . using a bayesian maximum - likelihood fitting technique \\n , they find a significant correlation between @xmath5 ( bolometric ) and @xmath247 , with a power - law slope of @xmath248 and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath249 . \\n it must be noted that they introduce a prior weighting , @xmath250 , which gives more weight to models with lower scatter . \\n again , it is difficult to directly compare our measurement of the slope and scatter to the @xcite measurements , due to different richness quantities and selection functions . \\n a large intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation can account for optically - selected clusters that appear `` underluminous '' in x - rays as compared to their optical richness  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) . in particular , @xcite present a set of `` abell x - ray underluminous '' ( axu ) clusters with masses determined from velocity dispersion measurements , that are significantly dimmer in x - rays than expected . in figure \\n [ fig : linmix ] the seven axu clusters that match to maxbcg ( @xmath2 , @xmath233 ) are denoted with open squares . \\n these are all significantly dimmer than the mean @xmath5@xmath6 relation , but are fully consistent with the observed scatter . \\n velocity dispersion measurements of maxbcg clusters  ( b07 ) and comparisons to simulations  @xcite have shown that there is considerable mass - mixing in a given @xmath6 bin . \\n the low - luminosity clusters could be from lower - mass halos that are picked up as moderate richness in the cluster finder . \\n however , @xcite argue that the axu clusters have low @xmath5 relative to their mass . \\n this could be due to biases in masses calculated from velocity dispersions with small samples  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ) , or to large intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5@xmath13 relation  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n each of these possibilities ( or a combination of the two ) are consistent with the observations . \\n we further explore the @xmath5@xmath13 relation of maxbcg clusters in a companion letter  @xcite . \\n we have reason to believe that the scatter is not fixed as a function of richness . \\n for example , b07 find a significantly larger scatter in the velocity dispersion - richness ( @xmath251@xmath1 ) relation at low richness compared to high richness \\n . however , the quality of our data for this exercise is not adequate to constrain the change in the scatter as a function of richness . \\n therefore , for the remainder of the paper we adopt this nominal value of @xmath241 to correct the stacked ( mean ) @xmath0 to obtain the underlying median @xmath227 values . \\n this essentially requires us to multiply all @xmath0 values by a factor of @xmath252 . \\n we can compare the @xmath227@xmath1 relation for optically - selected maxbcg clusters to that from x - ray selected clusters from the literature . \\n for this exercise we chose to compare to the noras  @xcite and 400 square degree  ( 400d : * ? ? ? * ) catalogs , both constructed from rosat data , and thus measured in the same energy range as used in this work . \\n the noras catalog is an x - ray flux limited cluster catalog constructed from the rass photon maps in the northern sky . \\n although it is known to be only @xmath55 complete , it provides a large sample of bright x - ray clusters that overlap the maxbcg survey region . \\n the 400d catalog is a serendipitous x - ray flux limited cluster catalog constructed from pointed rosat pspc observations . \\n the 400d catalog covers fields sampled from the whole sky , and thus only @xmath249 of the catalog overlaps the maxbcg survey region . \\n our intention in this exercise is to obtain a baseline comparison of the x - ray and optical richness properties of x - ray selected clusters to optically - selected clusters . \\n a somewhat different comparison of noras and maxbcg , focused on testing the completeness of maxbcg , was performed in @xcite .    to obtain a list of clean matches between noras or 400d clusters and maxbcg clusters , we require that the x - ray position and bcg position be matched within @xmath253 , and the redshift difference to be less than 0.05 . \\n this ensures both that the probability of a false match is @xmath254 and that we are not selecting , e.g. , merging clusters where the x - ray and optical catalogs might utilize different deblending schemes . \\n there are 89 noras clusters that match maxbcg , with a median redshift of @xmath255 , and 53 400d clusters that match maxbcg , with a median redshift of @xmath256 . \\n we convert all x - ray luminosities to 0.1 - 2.4  kev in the rest frame with our adopted cosmology . \\n note that the @xmath5 values obtained in noras and 400d have been corrected for aperture effects . \\n however , with the adopted @xmath108 parameters ( @xmath257 for noras , and @xmath258 for 400d ) these corrections produce at most a @xmath237 offset in @xmath5 compared to the luminosities obtained in our scaled @xmath37 apertures . \\n figure  [ fig : catmatches ] shows @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 for the x - ray selected clusters that meet our matching criteria . \\n the solid circles represent noras clusters , and the empty squares represent 400d clusters . \\n the luminosities of the 400d clusters are typically less than that for noras due to the deeper flux limit of the pointed rosat observations relative to the rass survey . \\n the dashed line shows the median @xmath227@xmath1 relation , and the dotted lines show the @xmath243 scatter constraints . \\n it is not surprising to note that x - ray selection picks out primarily the x - ray brightest clusters at a given richness ; nearly all the noras clusters lie above the median maxbcg relation . \\n the deeper 400d survey selects a sample more representative of the optically - selected clusters , though it is still biased high . \\n comparison to figure  [ fig : linmix ] is instructive . at every richness , the typical x - ray emission from clusters is significantly below what you might expect from x - ray selected catalogs . \\n while this is true for both catalogs , it is especially apparent for noras clusters . \\n although the 400d survey has the sensitivity to detect the richest x - ray dim clusters ( as in the lower - right corner of figure  [ fig : linmix ] ) , these clusters are quite rare . \\n the limited overlap between the 400d survey region and the maxbcg survey region means that it is very unlikely that the 400d survey would contain one of these specific maxbcg clusters . \\n there are a variety of systematic effects which may bias the @xmath227@xmath1 relation . in this section \\n we address six : photometric redshift uncertainty , cluster centering errors , richness variation with redshift , bcg luminosity , point source contamination , and cool core clusters . \\n the maxbcg cluster catalog is based on photometric data , and thus we only have photometric redshifts ( `` photo-@xmath31s '' ) for each of the clusters . while the photo-@xmath31s are relatively precise ( @xmath11 ) , we must investigate how using photometric redshift estimates might bias our stacking results . \\n if a cluster is actually closer than its photometric redshift would suggest , it will be over - weighted in the stacking analysis . when it is more distant than it seems , it will be underweighted . \\n even if the photo-@xmath31 errors are perfectly symmetric , the weighting factor , @xmath83 , is not . as a result , \\n uncertainty in photo-@xmath31 can introduce a bias in the luminosities . \\n this bias can become significant if the photo-@xmath31 errors are large . \\n the net impact of this effect is to make the clusters appear more luminous than they truly are . \\n there is also a small volume effect caused by photo-@xmath31 errors . at a fixed redshift @xmath31 \\n there is a larger physical volume at a larger distance @xmath259 than at a smaller distance @xmath260 . \\n because of this , more clusters are available at high redshift to scatter low than at low redshift to scatter high . \\n this is similar to malmquist bias . \\n as above , this effect will cause us to overestimate the cluster luminosities . \\n in addition , the photometric redshift is used to calculate the cluster extraction radius . \\n when a cluster is closer than its photo-@xmath31 implies , then the extraction radius used is too small , slightly reducing its implied luminosity . \\n the opposite is true when the cluster is farther than its measured photo-@xmath31 . \\n as there is very little cluster flux at large radii , and as this bias is roughly symmetric , we do not expect this effect to strongly bias the stacked @xmath5 . \\n we run a monte carlo simulation to estimate the combined photo-@xmath31 bias as a function of richness . around @xmath261 of the bcgs in the maxbcg catalog used in this analysis \\n have spectroscopic redshifts from the sdss dr5 spectroscopic catalog  @xcite . with the spectroscopic subsample \\n , we measure the photo-@xmath31 offset ( @xmath262 ) distribution in each richness bin and three redshift bins . \\n a monte carlo is performed to estimate the overall bias in the measured luminosity by comparing the `` true '' luminosities convolved with the @xmath263 distribution to the `` observed '' luminosities at the measured photometric redshifts . \\n we find that the overall bias is small ( @xmath264 at 99% confidence limit ) , with the observed luminosities slightly overestimating the true luminosities . \\n this bias factor does not vary with richness . \\n we neglect this correction factor due to its small magnitude .      in our stacking exercise , we chose the bcg as the center of the cluster . \\n for many clusters with individual x - ray observations and a bright bcg , this is coincident with the x - ray center . \\n however , there are several types of clusters in which the bcg is not consistent with the center of the x - ray emission . \\n these include merging clusters with disturbed morphologies ; clusters without a dominant central galaxy for unambiguous detection by the maxbcg algorithm ; and a few ( @xmath265 ) previously identified strong cooling flow clusters . \\n the central galaxies in these clusters host bright agn and exhibit strong star formation , moving their colors off the red sequence and excluding them from the maxbcg cluster finding algorithm . \\n we do not expect centering biases to be a significant problem for our calculation of the mean x - ray luminosity for the following reasons . \\n first , the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the electron density @xmath266 , and thus most of the luminosity comes from the central region . with our large apertures ( @xmath267 ) \\n as long as the core of a cluster is within the aperture , the photon counting exercise will include most of the cluster photons . \\n second , we have reason to believe from simulations that most of the richer clusters are well centered  ( j07 ) . \\n this is not to say that the cluster centering will not have any effect : as shown in section  [ sec : profiles ] , the @xmath108-model parameter is highly dependent on the centering distribution .    to confirm this , we perform some simple tests of de - centering the clusters . if we randomly offset all the cluster positions with a 2d gaussian with an rms of @xmath268  ( comparable to the centering distribution modeled in j07 ) , the mean @xmath0 values decrease by @xmath269 , and less than @xmath106 \\n this rms value was chosen because , as is seen in figure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] , the vast majority of the x - ray cluster matches are within @xmath253 . therefore , we do not consider cluster miscentering to contribute a significant bias to our x - ray luminosity calculation . \\n we investigate whether the observed @xmath0 at fixed richness changes with redshift . \\n modest evolution in @xmath0 at fixed _ mass _ is expected . \\n if the clusters are evolving in a self - similar manner , then we expect the higher redshift clusters to be more luminous than the lower redshift clusters , due to the fact that the universe was more dense at higher redshift . \\n the expectation is that @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath31  @xcite . \\n therefore , clusters at a given _ mass _ at a redshift @xmath272 should be @xmath273 brighter than similar clusters at a redshift of @xmath274 . \\n to study possible variation of @xmath0 at fixed richness , we split the cluster sample into three redshift bins , containing the bottom 25% , middle 50% , and top 25% of clusters in our sample . \\n the low redshift bin ranges from @xmath275 with a median redshift of @xmath276 ; the middle redshift bin ranges from @xmath277 with a median redshift of @xmath41 ; and the high redshift bin ranges from @xmath278 with a median of @xmath279 . to obtain increased signal - to - noise in these bins , we combine richness bins @xmath63 and @xmath62 ; @xmath65 and @xmath64 ; and @xmath280 and @xmath66 . \\n these wider bins are the same that were used in the lensing analysis of s07 . \\n figure  [ fig : splitzplot ] shows the stacked @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for the three different richness bins . \\n the dashed line shows the mean relation ( equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] ) for all clusters from section  [ sec : meanrelation ] . \\n the high redshift clusters ( diamonds ) are significantly more luminous than the low redshift clusters ( circles ) . \\n we parameterize the variation with a factor of @xmath281 , and fit all the redshift and richness bins simultaneously with a model of the form : @xmath282 where @xmath41 , the median redshift of the cluster catalog . \\n this results in a good fit ( @xmath283 ) with the best - fit parameters : @xmath284 ; @xmath285 ; @xmath286 . note that @xmath287 and @xmath108 are consistent with the mean relation in equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] . \\n the redshift variation parameter , @xmath288 , is quite large , and shows that the high redshift bin ( @xmath279 ) is almost twice as bright as the low redshift bin ( @xmath276 ) . \\n this is significantly in excess of the self - similar prediction . \\n the challenge is to determine the origin of this redshift dependent shift in @xmath0 at fixed richness . \\n the photo-@xmath31 errors described in section  [ sec : photoz ] may account for some of this effect . \\n although the absolute photo-@xmath31 errors are better than @xmath289 at all redshifts , the _ relative _ photo-@xmath31 errors are larger at low redshift than at high . \\n therefore , the impact of photo-@xmath31 bias is larger at low redshift than at high redshift . \\n we repeated the monte carlo simulation described in section  [ sec : photoz ] to measure the photo-@xmath31 bias from each redshift bin . \\n the additional redshift bias is @xmath290 ( 99% confidence limit ) in the low redshift bin , and @xmath291 ( 99% confidence limit ) in the high redshift bin . \\n the photo-@xmath31 bias therefore remains smaller than the observed variation in @xmath5 , although the effect is in the same sense as the variation we observe , and is a contributing factor . \\n a more likely possibility is redshift dependent variation of @xmath6 at fixed mass . \\n if our high redshift clusters have systematically smaller @xmath6 at fixed mass , this would have the effect of shifting the high redshift points in figure  [ fig : splitzplot ] to the left . in order to constrain this bias , \\n we must first factor out the effect of the self - similar evolution of @xmath0 at fixed mass , using the expected redshift dependence @xmath292 as described above . \\n we then re - fit the data to equation  [ eqn : zgamma ] to calculate the excess variation in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation that may be attributed to variation of @xmath6 at fixed mass . \\n this results in a best - fit @xmath293 , implying a fractional decrease in @xmath6 of @xmath294@xmath295 from our lowest redshift bin ( @xmath296 ) to our highest redshift bin ( @xmath297 ) . \\n this is consistent with the redshift dependent variation in the velocity dispersion \\n optical richness relation measured by b07 . \\n however , we must note that redshift dependence in the observed lensing shear , @xmath298 , is significantly smaller  ( s07 ) . \\n unfortunately , none of these approaches is yet able to confidently determine the nature of the observed variation . \\n for example , this effect could be caused by incorrect handling of the 0.4  @xmath18 and color cuts that determine which galaxies are included in the richness estimate . \\n it might also be `` true '' evolution , such that clusters have fewer red - sequence galaxies brighter than 0.4 @xmath18 at fixed mass at higher redshifts . \\n further work , including improving the richness estimates , is in progress to constrain the nature of this evolution . \\n we now investigate the effect bcg @xmath30-band luminosity ( @xmath299 , see @xcite for details ) has on the mean x - ray luminosity @xmath0 . \\n simulations and semi - analytical modeling predict that dark matter halos formed at early times have brighter bcgs and lower richness than those which form late  @xcite . \\n thus , we expect that the x - ray luminosity should be correlated with @xmath299 at fixed richness . \\n furthermore , optical and x - ray observations of individual nearby clusters show that more luminous bcgs are correlated with more massive halos with higher x - ray temperature and luminosity  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n this trend has already been seen in the mean velocity dispersion analysis of maxbcg clusters , as the clusters with more luminous bcgs had significantly larger velocity dispersions than clusters with similar richness  ( b07 ) .    in an exercise similar to that performed in the previous section , we split each wide richness bin into three bins of @xmath299 . \\n as @xmath299 , unlike redshift , is correlated with @xmath6 , we are unable to use the same @xmath299 split for each @xmath6 bin . \\n therefore , we sort the clusters in each richness bin by @xmath299 , and split the sample into the top 25% , middle 50% , and bottom 25% , and then restack . \\n the results are shown in figure  [ fig : splitbcgplot ] . it is readily apparent that the clusters with the most luminous bcg in a given richness bin ( diamonds ) are significantly more luminous in x - rays than other clusters in the bin . \\n this effect is most dramatic at lower richnesses . \\n this is expected , as the bcg is more dominant in low richness clusters than high richness clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n it is also notable that there does not appear to be a significant difference between the @xmath0 for the low @xmath299 and middle @xmath299 bins . \\n we parameterize the effect of @xmath299 on @xmath0 using a similar procedure as performed for the redshift variation . \\n the richness and @xmath299 bins are fit simultaneously with a model of the form : @xmath300 this results in an adequate fit ( @xmath301 ) with the best - fit parameters : @xmath302 ; @xmath303 ; @xmath304 . \\n although the normalization is the same as in equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] , the slope is significantly more shallow . \\n this is caused by the correlation between @xmath299 and @xmath6 . \\n after taking this into account , the mean relation shown here is fully consistent with that calculated without splitting the bins by @xmath299 . \\n the reason the @xmath145 of the fit is relatively high is because it does not appear that @xmath0 is smooth function of @xmath305 : the effect of @xmath299 is not symmetric , and only tends to boost the x - ray luminosity of clusters with relatively bright bcgs . \\n it is not entirely clear whether this effect is due to an imperfect cluster finder , our crude richness definition , or due to real cluster physics . \\n clusters with brighter , more dominant bcgs are more likely to be correctly centered and thus might be more luminous in x - rays . \\n however , as we showed in section  [ sec : centering ] , the effect of decentered clusters on @xmath0 is much smaller than the effect we see due to @xmath299 . \\n meanwhile , our richness definition , @xmath6 , is a count of red - sequence galaxies brighter than @xmath306 . \\n it is thus not surprising that a poor cluster with an exceptionally bright bcg might be more massive and more x - ray luminous than a cluster at a similar richness with a more typical bcg . \\n finally , it is possible that these clusters are associated with halos that formed early , allowing many of their member galaxies to merge into a very large bcg  @xcite . deeper targeted x - ray observations of specific clusters will be required to determine if we can use @xmath299 and other optical properties to constrain the age of its dark matter halo .      when calculating the projected x - ray luminosity from the hot intracluster medium , there is the possibility of contamination due to x - ray point sources . \\n some point sources , such as cluster agn , are associated with the cluster , but in general their luminosities are not tightly correlated with that of the icm . \\n other point sources that are chance coincidences , such as foreground stars and background quasars , might also boost the apparent luminosity . \\n the problem of point source contamination is exacerbated by the broad psf of the rass survey . \\n due to the large psf , it is difficult to accurately excise point sources from the higher redshift clusters , even when their positions are known . for the stacking exercise , \\n foreground and background sources are not a significant problem . assuming the positions of these point sources are uncorrelated with the cluster positions , the contribution from these sources is subtracted with the background estimation , as is demonstrated by our stack of random points in figure  [ fig : imageplots ] . at the same time , these point sources , both those associated with the clusters and those that are chance projections , may increase the observed scatter . in general \\n , we note that @xmath5 values calculated from rass are not corrected for point source contamination  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n we wish to perform a first - order check on possible contamination from cluster agn , the dominating point sources that might bias the observed @xmath0 . \\n @xcite have recently performed a detailed survey of the distribution of agn in galaxy clusters for eight moderate redshift clusters , comparable to the redshift range of the maxbcg catalog . \\n they find that moderately bright agn ( @xmath307 ) associated with bright cluster members ( @xmath308 ) make up around @xmath309 of the total cluster member population . \\n this implies that many of the richest maxbcg clusters contain at least one moderately bright agn . \\n these clusters have an extremely bright icm ( @xmath310 ) , and thus the fraction of the luminosity from cluster agn will , on average , be very small . \\n if we extrapolate the same agn fraction to our poorest clusters ( @xmath311 , perhaps one in ten will host a moderately bright agn . although these agn might have a luminosity comparable to the icm for these @xmath312 of poor clusters , this small fraction should not strongly bias the stacked average .    as a simple check for contamination in the x - ray signal from cluster agn \\n , we match maxbcg cluster member galaxies to radio sources from the first survey  @xcite with a match radius of @xmath313 . by matching random galaxies from sdss dr5 to the first sources \\n , we estimate the purity of the matches to be @xmath314 . \\n the first survey covers approximately the same footprint as the sdss , down to a typical flux limit of @xmath315 at 1.4 ghz . \\n using 1.4 ghz radio detections as a proxy for agn activity has the advantage that the radio spectrum is often flat , and thus the 1.4 ghz flux is not a strong function of redshift . \\n the disadvantages are that only 10% of x - ray bright quasars and agn are radio loud , and that there is a large scatter between x - ray and radio luminosities of these objects . for example \\n , @xcite noted that for the same small set of clusters none of the x - ray selected agn are radio loud  @xcite . \\n although we have an incomplete selection function , we can still constrain the contamination from cluster agn . if the mean @xmath0 is significantly boosted by cluster agn \\n , then we would expect the clusters which match radio sources to be relatively bright . \\n this effect would be greatest at low richness and low @xmath0 when the icm is not as hot or bright . \\n for each richness bin , we matched the maxbcg cluster members within @xmath146 of the bcg to sources in the first survey . \\n table  [ tab : radiomatch ] shows the number of clusters in each bin that have members matched with the first catalog . \\n more detailed work is in progress in cross - correlating the maxbcg catalog with radio sources to explore cluster agn feedback and related issues ( see also @xcite ) . \\n ccc @xmath61 & 45 & 82% + @xmath62 & 91 & 65% + @xmath63 & 125 & 62% + @xmath64 & 183 & 54% + @xmath65 & 284 & 45% + @xmath66 & 420 & 37% + @xmath67 & 332 & 30% + @xmath68 & 1330 & 25% + @xmath69 & 1341 & 18% +    we wish to compare how the radio selected subset of clusters compares to a randomly selected subset of clusters of similar richness . in each richness bin , we ran 10000 trials by sampling ( with replacement ) from the entire set of clusters in the bin , sampling the same number of clusters that match radio sources . as a quick estimate of the mean luminosity , rather than performing the full stacking analysis and spectral fits , we calculated the stacked and weighted , background - subtracted hard channel ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) counts in a fixed @xmath146 aperture . \\n the resulting count rate was converted to @xmath0 using the method described in section  [ sec : scatter ] . \\n we can then compare the mean @xmath0 of the clusters which match radio sources to the typical values of @xmath0 that we would expect when drawing that same number of clusters from the entire sample . \\n the results are shown in figure  [ fig : radiomatch ] . in each panel \\n the histogram shows the distribution of @xmath0 values obtained from the resampling , and the vertical dashed line marks the mean @xmath0 of the radio - matched clusters . \\n we do not see any significant bias as a function of richness . \\n the only bin in which the radio matches appear to be outliers is the @xmath316 richness bin . \\n this is due to random chance , in that the clusters in this richness bin with the highest @xmath5 also happen to match radio sources ; although there is no obvious indication in the rass data that there is point source contamination on these clusters , further follow - up with _ chandra _ or _ xmm / newton _ would be required to clarify this . \\n there is much evidence that cool core clusters increase the scatter in x - ray cluster properties . by excluding cluster cores in high resolution imaging , \\n many x - ray parameters become more tightly correlated  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n the broad rosat psf , combined with the fact that most of our clusters do not have individual x - ray detections , makes it impossible to exclude cluster cores in our stacking analysis . however , a few of the brightest clusters ( @xmath317 ) at moderate richness ( @xmath318 ) are well known cool - core clusters . \\n we thus investigate what effect cool core clusters have on our estimate of the median @xmath227 and scatter @xmath221 in the @xmath227@xmath1 relation . \\n there does not exist an unbiased volume - limited catalog of cool core x - ray clusters which can be fairly compared to the maxbcg catalog . \\n @xcite used rosat pointed observations of an x - ray flux limited catalog  @xcite to estimate the central cooling time of 55 nearby clusters . \\n two of these clusters are in the maxbcg catalog ( a1689 , a2244 ) and exhibit characteristics of a cool core ( @xmath319 ) . \\n @xcite used _ chandra _ observations of the higher redshift ( @xmath320 ) bcs clusters to systematically estimate the central cooling time of bright x - ray clusters . \\n we identify 7 maxbcg clusters ( a750 , a963 , a1835 , rxj 2129.6 + 0005 , z2701 , z3146 , z7160 ) from this sample with cooling times @xmath319 which we mark as cool core clusters . \\n finally , we identify clg  j1504 - 0248  @xcite as maxbcg cluster with a cool core . \\n it should be noted that most of these clusters have a moderate richness ( @xmath321 ) and are in the brightest tail of the @xmath5 distribution for their richness . \\n furthermore , the central galaxies of these clusters tend to show strong @xmath322 emission in sdss spectroscopy . \\n in fact , for a few of these clusters the true bcg is not in the list of cluster members because the strong @xmath322 emission changes the apparent galaxy color , making it inconsistent with the red - sequence used in the cluster finding algorithm .    after excluding these known cool core clusters ( which might bias the @xmath227@xmath6 relation ) we recalculate the stacked mean relationship as well as the median relationship with scatter . when calculating the median relationship with scatter , as in section  [ sec : scatter ] , the normalization and slope shift by @xmath323 , as these values are not strongly affected by outliers . \\n however , the intrinsic observed scatter decreases to @xmath324 , which is a @xmath325 shift . \\n it is not surprising that @xmath221 decreases : we are deliberately removing the brightest clusters . \\n meanwhile , the stacked relation is also slightly affected by these bright outliers , and after cutting the known cool core clusters the normalization of the stacked relation decreases by @xmath326 . after following the previously described prescription for converting the stacked mean relation to a scatter - corrected median relation \\n , we find that removing the known cool core clusters decreases the normalization by @xmath209 . \\n therefore , it does not appear that the known , very x - ray luminous , cool core clusters , are significantly biasing our relation . \\n we reiterate that the intrinsic scatter we measure is the _ observed _ scatter that takes into account _ all _ x - ray observations of the maxbcg clusters , regardless of x - ray morphology of the clusters . \\n thus , it is likely that some portion of this observed scatter is caused by unidentified cool core clusters in the sample . \\n b07 have measured the median velocity dispersion ( @xmath328 ) as a function of @xmath1 for the maxbcg catalog . \\n the richness bins used to measure the stacked velocity dispersions , as well as the scatter in the @xmath12@xmath6 relation , are the same as those used in this work . however , in order to measure velocity dispersions , only clusters that have the bcg and at least one additional member galaxy in the sdss dr5 spectroscopic subsample  @xcite were used . \\n the spectroscopic subsample preferentially selects bright / nearby galaxies , and thus the selection of clusters used in b07 ( @xmath329 , with @xmath330 ) is slightly different than that for the full maxbcg catalog ( @xmath331 , with @xmath332 ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : redshift ] , the lower redshift clusters have a smaller @xmath0 than the higher redshift clusters . \\n we therefore re - run our stacking procedure on exactly those clusters used in b07 , and use the known spectroscopic redshifts of the bcgs rather than the photometric redshifts . \\n this ensures that , for this exercise at least , we are not affected by any possible photometric redshift biases , which otherwise could be significant for the nearest clusters ( @xmath333 ) where the relative photo-@xmath31 error ( @xmath334 ) is quite large . table  [ tab : lxsig ] shows the richness bins used , as well as the mean @xmath0 ( this work ) and median @xmath327 ( from b07 ) for the nine richness bins . \\n the slope of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is nearly identical for the spectroscopic subsample as reported in section  [ sec : meanrelation ] , but the normalization is lower by @xmath312 , due to the different redshift selection . \\n ccccc @xmath61 & 83.9 & 1.69 & @xmath335 & @xmath336 + @xmath62 & 58.4 & 1.45 & @xmath337 & @xmath338 + @xmath63 & 44.7 & 1.32 & @xmath339 & @xmath338 + @xmath64 & 35.9 & 1.22 & @xmath340 & @xmath341 + @xmath65 & 28.6 & 1.10 & @xmath342 & @xmath343 + @xmath66 & 22.7 & 1.02 & @xmath344 & @xmath345 + @xmath67 & 19.0 & 0.94 & @xmath346 & @xmath347 + @xmath68 & 14.0 & 0.82 & @xmath348 & @xmath349 + @xmath69 & 9.9 & 0.73 & @xmath350 & @xmath351 +    we take the mean @xmath0 values and corrected them for scatter as described in section  [ sec : scatter ] to obtain @xmath227 . \\n figure  [ fig : lxsig ] shows the median @xmath227@xmath327 relation for maxbcg clusters with richness @xmath352 . each data point ( solid circles ) is obtained from the same richness bin and same cluster selection . \\n the dark gray band shows the best - fit relation ( @xmath353 ) from clusters in the spectroscopic subsample of the maxbcg catalog , with the following functional form : @xmath354 the scaling relation predicted by self - similar cluster evolution is that @xmath355  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) , which is consistent with our observations . \\n we note that if we could convert our 0.1 - 2.4  kev luminosities to @xmath202 , this would steepen our relation , as the clusters with higher velocity dispersions also have a higher temperature and larger @xmath356 ratio . \\n as mentioned previously , such a conversion is not practical for the stacking exercise using rosat data . \\n the slope of our 0.1 - 2.4 kev @xmath227@xmath327 relation is consistent with that measured for reflex clusters  @xcite . \\n we compare this median relation to that obtained previously for individual x - ray selected clusters . \\n @xcite calculated the velocity dispersions of reflex clusters by cross - correlating the reflex catalog with the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey  ( 2df ; * ? ? ? \\n figure  [ fig : lxsig ] shows 39 individual reflex clusters ( empty circles ) from hilton , et al . \\n ( 2007 , private communication ) after converting the velocity dispersions to the cluster rest frame . in the upper - left corner \\n the empty circle shows the typical errors in 0.1 - 2.4 kev @xmath5 and @xmath12 for the reflex/2df clusters . \\n @xcite found the slope of the x - ray selected @xmath5@xmath12 relation to be @xmath357 , consistent with our observations . \\n however , the individual x - ray selected clusters tend to have a slightly higher ( @xmath326 ) velocity dispersion at a given x - ray luminosity compared to the stacked maxbcg clusters . \\n this is possibly caused by the difficulty in measuring velocity dispersions for individual clusters . \\n contamination from non - virialized galaxies and interlopers will more likely result in an overestimate of the velocity dispersion rather than an underestimate . \\n by stacking observations from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , we measure the mean x - ray luminosity as a function of richness for optically - selected clusters from the maxbcg catalog . with a large number of clusters in each bin , the stacking exercise has the power to probe to much lower flux limits than are possible for x - ray selected surveys . \\n thus , a highly pure and complete volume - limited catalog with clusters selected by their optical properties can be used to measure the mean @xmath0 . \\n we find that @xmath0 scales with optical richness , @xmath6 , with a simple power - law form over two orders of magnitude in @xmath0 . \\n our results are similar to those obtained in dkm07 by stacking rass observations of clusters identified in 2mass . \\n however , we find that stacked temperature measurements from _ rosat _ are significantly biased for higher temperature clusters . \\n therefore , we restrict our analysis to luminosities calculated in the 0.1 - 2.4  kev band rather than extrapolating to calculate bolometric luminosities . furthermore , we have shown that the @xmath108-model fits to the stacked radial profiles of moderate redshift clusters are dominated by a combination of the broad _ rosat _ psf and the offset distribution between maxbcg clusters and correlated x - ray sources . on the other hand , calculating x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , which relies primarily on counting photons , is not strongly biased by spectral fits or profile fits . as @xmath5 scales with the square of the density , as long as the core of a cluster is within the stacking aperture , we can obtain a high reliability estimate of the mean cluster luminosity .    by measuring the x - ray flux at the positions of individual maxbcg clusters , we are able to constrain the observed scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation . assuming a log - normal distribution of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 , we find @xmath241 . \\n this scatter is quite large , and thus it is necessary to correct for the scatter when calculating the median of the underlying distribution @xmath227 . \\n the richness measure we have used in this work , @xmath6 , is simply the count of red - sequence galaxies within a scaled @xmath37 aperture , but nevertheless is a good proxy for @xmath5 on average . \\n it is likely that improved richness measurements can be made . from the evidence presented here , it seems likely that these new richness estimators will include information about bcg luminosity , and will more carefully control variations in cluster membership with redshift . \\n the large scatter in the @xmath5richness relation does have some significant effects on cluster selection . \\n first , x - ray selection with a high flux limit , as with the noras catalog , tends to pick out the clusters with the highest @xmath5 at a given richness . \\n second , the large scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation means that there are a significant number of optically selected clusters that are seemingly `` underluminous '' . \\n optically selected clusters will often appear relatively dim compared to x - ray selected clusters at a similar richness . \\n the goal of cluster selection and identification is to find a low scatter proxy for halo mass . \\n both x - ray and optical selection techniques suffer from different limitations . \\n x - ray flux limited surveys can only find the brightest x - ray clusters , and are thus limited to a combination of the brightest and nearest clusters . furthermore , there may be significant scatter between x - ray luminosity and halo mass  @xcite . \\n optical surveys such as maxbcg may be volume limited out to moderate redshift , but optical richness also has a large scatter with respect to x - ray luminosity and mass  ( b07 ) . \\n the development of more precise mass proxies , including @xmath204 , the compton y parameter @xcite , @xmath358  @xcite , and potentially more sophisticated optical richness estimates may allow selection of cluster catalogs more closely approximating the mass - limited catalog we aspire to .    by combining our present analysis with the velocity dispersion measurements of b07 \\n , we have measured the median @xmath227@xmath327 relation for the maxbcg clusters . \\n the relation has a slope of @xmath359 , consistent with the prediction of self - similar cluster evolution . \\n previous measurements of the @xmath5@xmath12 relation have been complicated by both selection effects and a large scatter , as the derived slope depends strongly on the fitting technique used . by stacking clusters from a volume - limited catalog and correcting for scatter , both @xmath227 and @xmath327 \\n are much better constrained , allowing a robust calculation of the relation . in our analysis \\n , we do not see any evidence of a break in the @xmath227@xmath327 relation at the poor cluster ( group ) scale , as has been hinted at previously  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n . this might be due to the fact that the maxbcg cluster finder works with red - sequence clusters , and does not find groups with a large blue galaxy fraction . \\n we can also compare @xmath0 as determined from this method to weak lensing masses determined from the same maxbcg cluster catalog  ( s07 , j07 ) . \\n determining the @xmath5@xmath13 relation is not only important for understanding cluster physics , but for calibrating the selection function of x - ray clusters used as cosmological probes  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n we have made this measurement in a companion letter  @xcite . \\n in addition , the comparison of the x - ray luminosities , weak lensing masses , and velocity dispersions can be used in conjunction with the number function of maxbcg clusters to constrain cosmological parameters  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . \\n this work is ongoing . \\n refined measurements of the scatter , point source contamination , and confirmation of catalog purity will require deeper pointed x - ray observations . \\n we are currently investigating serendipitous maxbcg cluster observations by deeper pointed _ rosat_/pspc observations , as well as _ \\n xmm / newton _ and _ chandra _  ( e.g. * ? ? ? \\n unfortunately , most of the serendipitous cluster observations are of relatively poor clusters , which are much more numerous . \\n a targeted campaign of a representative sample of maxbcg clusters that have not previously been known to be x - ray bright will be essential to both test our measurement of the scatter in @xmath5@xmath6 and to estimate the fraction of cluster flux that is contaminated by point sources . \\n this will be essential to enable future inexpensive deep optical cluster surveys such as des  @xcite to use optical properties of clusters to estimate which clusters would be most useful to follow -

( 5 - 7 ) ] \\n is well justified as it takes into account the most relevant modes for the pump field : higher order harmonics at @xmath81 are much smaller than the ones at @xmath82 , allowing neglection of the contribution of terms with @xmath31 , i.e. modulations below the pc wavelength . on the other hand \\n , the introduction of the modulation does not have any effect on the signal , whose main components are always the modes at the critical wave - number @xmath83 . \\n then we restrict our analysis to the modes @xmath84 in eq . \\n ( [ eq : enfourier ] ) . within this assumption , \\n we reduce the study of the pcopo dynamics below threshold to four coupled operators equations that in the frequency domain read @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are denoted as @xmath89 and @xmath90 . \\n the vector @xmath91 is expressed in a similar manner . \\n the matrix @xmath92 is @xmath93 from eqs . \\n ( [ eq : stationaryk ] ) and ( [ eq : stationaryk0 ] ) , with @xmath94 , we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the output fields are obtained from the input - output formalism @xmath98  @xcite , and their dynamics ( in the frequency domain @xmath2 ) is governed by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the @xmath101 identity . in the following we will concentrate on spatial quantum effects in the signal field . \\n therefore , we can omit without ambiguity the index @xmath102 . to calculate different correlations in the output variables given the input ones , we need to obtain the inverse of the matrix @xmath92 ( the expression for this inverse \\n is given in app . \\n [ sec : inversel ] ) . \\n this formalism is at the basis of the analytical quantum correlation for the output fields discussed in the following sections .    [ \\n cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the non classical feature of twin beams follows from the negativity of the variance @xmath103 and from the corresponding singularity of the p representation . \\n notice that terms @xmath104 , in the second row of the ( [ twin ] ) vanish for an opo in the absence of pc or when @xmath42 . \\n this is also evident from the analytical correlations given in the app . \\n [ sec : correlationsw ] . \\n conversely , these terms are large in pcopo whenever pc is affecting the signal , i.e. , for @xmath105 . \\n moreover , the last term @xmath106 vanishes , both for @xmath107 and for @xmath39 and @xmath105 , but it can contribute to the variance negativity for @xmath78 .    in particular , for @xmath107 , eq . \\n ( [ twin ] ) for the output fields yields the simple expression @xcite @xmath108 with shot noise @xmath109 . \\n therefore the normalized variance is always negative and constant below threshold . \\n this it not the case for a pcopo and in fig . \\n [ fig7]a we show twin beams correlations normalized by the shot noise for a fixed value of the pump and different pc modulations . \\n the opo is recovered at the origin , while the twin beams correlation is modified by the pc , becoming more classical for higher values of @xmath110 . \\n let us consider now the case of modulation only in the signal detuning , that is @xmath39 and @xmath105 . \\n we find for the twin beams correlations @xmath111 with shot noise @xmath112 . \\n the normalized expression of the twin beams diverges for @xmath113 , which in turn is the expression for the threshold , eq . \\n ( [ eq : thresh ] ) ( black solid curve in fig .  [ fig7]b ) . \\n we find that , even after normalization with the shot noise , the strength of these correlations is dependent on all parameters , while in the opo it was constant for any pump e. moreover , in fig . \\n [ fig7]b it is clear that the correlations are degraded and can become classical below threshold ( above red line ) . \\n finally , in fig . \\n [ fig7]c we present normalized twin beams correlations when only the pump detuning is modulated . in this case \\n correlations remains quantum for all pump strengths below threshold , even if there is a small reduction of this quantum effect . \\n an interpretation of these results can be given considering the modulation effects from the microscopic point of view . \\n a modulation in the signal ( pump ) detuning has the main effect to couple different spatial modes as also clear from eq.([eq : enfourier ] ) . in the particular case of a pc modulation with the periodicity ( [ 2kc ] ) \\n there are actually creation and destruction processes between photons at the critical tilted modes @xmath114 . \\n even if the nonlinearity gives rise to simultaneous creation ( annihilation ) of photons pairs in the signal , spatial modulation of the signal detuning leads to photons hopping between these opposite modes . \\n in other words there is a process of creation of one photon ( say @xmath115 ) and destruction of one in the opposite mode ( @xmath116 ) , as can be also seen from inspection of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . \\n therefore , twin beams correlations , due to photon pairs emission , are present for small hopping rates , but when the detuning modulation of the signal is increased , the variance ( [ twin - m1 ] ) becomes classical as the twin beams are depleted uncoherently . on the other hand , for @xmath42 and modulating the detuning of the pump field , \\n the hopping between different pump harmonics is still detrimental , as it triggers different secondary processes besides the twin photons pairs generation , but has a reduced effect . \\n we have shown the effect of an intracavity pc in a typical device displaying quantum light spatially correlated in continuous variables , as it is the degenerate opo type i. due to the translational symmetry breaking in the transverse profile there are several effects also evident in the noisy precursors locking ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . \\n the pc modulation has a deep influence in the instability process and parametric threshold are both raised and lowered depending on the configuration ( fig . \\n [ fig5 ] ) . as a consequence a modification in twin beams correlations , squeezing , separability , and entanglement were expected . in order to analytically evaluate these quantum correlations \\n we have introduced two main approximations valid below threshold , linearizing around the steady state where the signal field vanishes and restricting our analysis to few relevant harmonics ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . \\n we have considered a pc modulation ( [ 2kc ] ) and five modes , @xmath117 for the pump and @xmath118 for the signal . under these approximations we obtained good agreement between our results and the numerical solution of the full multimode nonlinear model , eqs . \\n ( [ eq : lang ] ) .    in our prototype model \\n the pc leads to a sinusoidal variation on the refractive index and , therefore , of the detunings that can affect pump , signal or both fields , depending on the values of the pc modulations @xmath119 and @xmath110 . \\n different configurations are described by tuning these parameters . \\n when the pc modulates the signal field , i.e. @xmath105 , the instability threshold rises in agreement with previous works concerning single resonant cavities and predicting pattern inhibition  @xcite . \\n we demonstrate that in presence of a parametric process the scenario is more complex and actually the threshold can also be reduced , when @xmath78 , and the instability favored . \\n non - classical phenomena such as squeezing and entanglement are very sensitive to the proximity of the instability point . \\n therefore the pc has deep consequences and can improve correlations at a given pump with respect to the opo , at least when threshold is lowered ( pump modulation ) . apart from this effect , \\n all correlations have been compared in opo and pcopo at a fixed distance from threshold . \\n then we have found that squeezing ( fig . \\n [ fig4 ] ) , separability , and epr - entanglement ( fig . \\n [ fig6 ] ) are preserved both in the reached values and in the width of the quadrature and superposition angles regions where these phenomena appear . \\n finally , we have analytically calculated twin beams correlations ( fig.[fig7 ] ) when varying the pc modulations @xmath119 and @xmath110 showing that deeper effects are actually present in these intensity correlations , even at a fixed distance from the threshold , and that in general secondary processes degrade correlations . besides , numerical simulations above threshold presented in a previous work  @xcite have revealed a significant enhancement of squeezing and entanglement . \\n overall , the pc allows to obtain the same quantum effects at a lower energy and one can enhance / avoid quantum properties of light , just by changing pump and/or signal spatial modulation in the cavity . \\n if we fourier transform in the temporal variable eqs . \\n ( [ eq : enfourier ] ) and neglect all the terms with @xmath121 in the signal and pump , we obtain @xmath122 where @xmath59 modes are coupled between them , namely @xmath123 we use a compact notation and denote @xmath124 simply as @xmath125 , @xmath126 as @xmath127 , and similarly for @xmath128 . \\n let us call @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 then we can write the matrix @xmath133 as @xmath134 this matrix allows the dynamical description of the fluctuations for all modes such that @xmath135 , with continuous index @xmath30 .    when considering the modulation @xmath136 with @xmath137 critical wavenumber , few intense modes are relevant and a reduced description can be obtained , leading to the @xmath138 matrix given in eq . \\n ( [ eq : matl ] ) . \\n the output fields dynamics is governed by the eqs . \\n ( [ eq : in -

It cites the lack of knowledge about various transitions of methanol maser as a reason for this. The article then goes on to say', \"methanol masers are often found in star - forming regions . \\n there are two sets of transitions seen to produce methanol masers . \\n class  i methanol masers ( most importantly the 36 and 44  ghz transitions ) are believed to be collisionally excited , while class  ii masers ( including the 6.7 and 12  ghz transitions ) are radiatively excited @xcite . \\n class  i and class  ii methanol masers are sometimes both found in association with the same source ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but the two classes of masers are very rarely seen at the same velocity or in close ( subarcsecond ) spatial overlap . \\n class  i methanol masers , in which shocks dominate over infrared radiation , have often been assumed to be tracing an earlier evolutionary state of star formation than class  ii methanol , water , or oh masers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n subcategorization of class  i masers by physical conditions may be possible @xcite , leading some authors to speculate that line intensity ratios among the class  i masers may be a proxy for evolutionary stage @xcite . \\n however , class  i maser studies have traditionally been biased towards regions hosting other tracers of star formation , and the cluster environments in which class  i masers are found are usually quite complex , calling into question traditional models of the evolutionary timeline of class  i masers ( section 4.4 of * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \\n furthermore , class  i masers have typically been observed with single - dish telescopes , which can identify whether or not a particular class  i transition produces masers in a region ( and how bright they are ) but do not have the resolution to determine their location relative to masers in other transitions . \\n given the complex environments associated with clustered star formation , high angular resolution is required to identify the relations between masers and excitation sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and between multiple transitions of methanol @xcite . \\n higher angular resolution is also necessary to understand the physical conditions that produce masers in each of the class  i transitions , which may not be identical ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n these concerns motivated @xcite to do an unbiased single - dish search for class  i methanol masers in nearby molecular clouds , resulting in the detection of new class  i maser features . several sites within these clouds \\n host previously known 44  ghz methanol masers , many of which have been mapped interferometrically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n imaging the 36  ghz masers , the other bright transition seen in numerous sources @xcite , has heretofore not been possible due to the lack of interferometers operating at this frequency . \\n however , recent upgrades to the australia telescope compact array and the expanded very large array ( evla ) are allowing the first arcsecond - resolution images of 36  ghz masers to be produced @xcite . in this letter \\n , we report on the first evla maps of the 36  ghz masers in the dr21 star - forming complex . \\n the evla was used to observe the 36.169  ghz @xmath0 line of methanol in dr21(oh ) , dr21w , and dr21n on 2010 may 26 . the array consisted of the 20 telescopes outfitted with ka - band receivers . \\n the evla was in its most compact ( d ) configuration , providing a synthesized beamwidth of approximately @xmath1 . \\n all three sources were observed in dual circular polarization centered on a fixed sky frequency of 36.1731  ghz and correlated with the new widar correlator . \\n the 4  mhz observing bandwidth was divided into 256 spectral channels , giving a velocity coverage of 33  kms@xmath2 with a channel spacing of 0.13  kms@xmath2 . \\n conversion from sky frequency to lsr velocity was performed with the assistance of the evla online dopset tool . \\n total on - source observing time was @xmath3  min per source . \\n typical single - channel noise levels were @xmath4  mjybeam@xmath2 near the center of the field    data reduction was carried out using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . \\n the flux scale was set using 3c48 . \\n complex gain calibration was done using j2048 + 4310 . \\n evla transition issues precluded accurate bandpass calibration , although it could be determined from calibrator data that baseline phases were flat across the entire observing band and amplitudes were flat across about 75% of the observing band . \\n thus , our main results , including estimates of the positions of the detected masers , should not be significantly affected , although bandpass effects may lead to amplitude errors of a few percent over most of the observed velocity range . \\n data were imaged , and flux densities were corrected for primary beam attenuation . \\n minor velocity errors may be introduced by two effects . \\n first , the uncertainty in the rest frequency of the observed line ( @xmath5  mhz ; * ? ? ? * ) is equivalent to a velocity uncertainty of 0.25  kms@xmath2 ( 2 channels ) . \\n second , observations were performed at a fixed sky frequency , since doppler tracking was unavailable . the sky frequency associated with \\n the rest frequency drifted by about 0.015  mhz over the course of the observations , possibly resulting in an insignificant spectral broadening of maser features . since the net uncertainty in determining the central velocity due to fixed - frequency observing ( @xmath6 a few @xmath7  kms@xmath2 ) is only a fraction of the channel separation ( and much smaller than a typical maser linewidth ) , the data were not corrected with cvel . \\n we present 229.758  ghz @xmath8 maser and 226  ghz continuum sma data for all of our sources ( p.  pratap et al . \\n , in preparation ) . \\n the angular resolution of these observations is @xmath9 . \\n the bandwidth of the 229  ghz observations covered the velocity range from @xmath10 to @xmath11  kms@xmath2 with a spectral resolution of 0.13  kms@xmath2 . \\n the flux densities of the 229  ghz masers were corrected for primary beam attenuation . \\n the rms noise near field center was approximately 0.15  jybeam@xmath2 for dr21(oh ) and dr21n and 0.3  jybeam@xmath2 for dr21w . \\n when possible , we compare our data against three other class  i methanol maser transitions from the literature : 44  ghz ( @xmath12 ) , 84  ghz ( @xmath13 ) , and 95  ghz ( @xmath14 ) . for dr21n , we also used archival 44  ghz data taken with the vla in b - configuration on 2006 jun 16 . \\n parameters of detected masers are listed in table  [ table - masers ] . \\n we detect 49 36  ghz maser features in the three observed dr21 sources : 21 in dr21n , 23 in dr21(oh ) , and 5 in dr21w . \\n figures  [ fig - map - oh ] and [ fig - maps - n - w ] show the locations of the 36  ghz masers relative to other class  i methanol transitions mapped with interferometric resolution . \\n the lsr velocities of detected masers are consistent with previous single - dish observations @xcite . \\n spectra of the integrated flux of individual 36  ghz maser features are often not well fit by a single gaussian . in some cases multiple spectral peaks \\n are evident , while in others there is evident skewness in the spectral peak . \\n both of these cases imply the existence of structure on scales smaller than our synthesized beam size ( 12 ) . \\n similar effects are seen in the 44  ghz transition , in which @xcite detect 17 masers in dr21(oh ) ( several with multiple spectral peaks ) using 10 minutes of vla d - configuration data , while @xcite detect 49 masers using a much longer integration of c - configuration data . when individual maser spectra in our data do show a single clear peak , we find that typical linewidths are on the order of 0.15 to 0.35  kms@xmath2 . \\n there is also a signature of very weak , extended methanol emission in some sources , but the lack of proper bandpass calibration tempers our confidence in this result . \\n there are 14 arcsecond - scale overlaps of a 36  ghz and a 229  ghz maser at approximately the same velocity ( @xmath15  kms@xmath2 ) . of these 14 associations , the 36  ghz maser is brighter in 7 , and the 229  ghz maser is brighter in the other 7 , indicating that either of the two @xmath16 lines may be brighter ( with the caveat that the 36 and 229  ghz observations did not occur simultaneously and that maser variability is possible ) . \\n a similar phenomenon is seen in the @xmath17 series , where @xcite find that while the integrated 95  ghz flux is in general higher than that at 44  ghz , the integrated fluxes of sources whose spectra consist of _ narrow - velocity _ 44 and 95  ghz features ( where the two transitions presumably produce single masers in close spatial association ) are comparable in the two transitions . \\n further high - resolution data will be necessary to examine the relation between the flux densities of different maser transitions seen in close spatial association with each other . \\n lrrrr dr21n & @xmath181.21 & 5.46 & 6.07 & 0.96 + & 3.30 & 1.33 & 0.76 & 23.72 + & 3.35 & 1.36 & 5.42 & 0.17 + & 5.10 & 3.25 & @xmath1812.58 & 0.31 + & 6.01 & @xmath180.43 & 3.22 & 0.40 + & 6.19 & @xmath180.26 & 6.07 & 0.19 + & 6.24 & @xmath186.84 & @xmath183.38 & 1.63 + & 7.73 & 10.83 & @xmath181.31 & 0.28 + & 8.56 & @xmath181.12 & @xmath182.61 & 0.28 + & 9.63 & 4.45 & @xmath184.94 & 0.25 + & 10.77 & 3.29 & @xmath185.71 & 0.18 + & 11.01 & @xmath183.54 & @xmath184.42 & 0.96 + & 11.28 & @xmath182.57 & @xmath184.42 & 0.37 + & 11.57 & @xmath184.19 & @xmath184.16 & 0.65 + & 12.54 & 8.44 & @xmath185.71 & 0.15 + & 12.75 & @xmath180.09 & @xmath184.42 & 0.31 + & 13.07 & @xmath184.16 & @xmath184.03 & 0.60 + & 13.30 & 5.92 & @xmath184.16 & 0.36 + & 14.64 & @xmath186.39 & @xmath183.12 & 10.08 + & 16.74 & @xmath183.14 & @xmath184.03 & 0.22 + & 20.77 & 11.47 & @xmath185.20 & 6.46 + dr21(oh ) & @xmath1825.86 & @xmath1824.96 & @xmath181.48 & 2.66 + & @xmath1821.08 & @xmath1820.95 & @xmath186.01 & 0.36 + & @xmath1818.88 & @xmath1830.34 & 0.47 & 2.67 + & @xmath1816.99 & 0.75 & 0.47 & 30.26 + & @xmath1816.34 & @xmath180.68 & @xmath181.35 & 1.26 + & @xmath1814.39 & @xmath1836.24 & @xmath185.62 & 0.60 + & @xmath1811.92 & 1.25 & @xmath180.05 & 1.31 + & @xmath1810.96 & 1.77 & @xmath181.35 & 0.52 + & @xmath1810.52 & @xmath181.72 & @xmath180.57 & 1.49 + & @xmath189.93 & @xmath182.98 & 0.08 & 10.39 + & @xmath187.10 & @xmath180.57 & @xmath181.61 & 2.39 + & @xmath186.24 & @xmath182.10 & 0.08 & 1.81 + & @xmath182.38 & @xmath1832.23 & @xmath185.49 & 0.82 + & 0.33 & @xmath1829.47 & @xmath185.88 & 0.54 + & 2.63 & @xmath1845.86 & @xmath184.20 & 7.61 + & 3.38 & @xmath1845.66 & @xmath185.62 & 0.86 + & 3.45 & 0.78 & @xmath183.68 & 0.15 + & 9.52 & @xmath184.73 & @xmath186.53 & 1.69 + & 13.40 & @xmath187.31 & @xmath185.88 & 0.42 + & 13.94 & @xmath182.89 & @xmath183.55 & 0.50 + & 15.48 & @xmath183.87 & @xmath184.71 & 0.85 + & 15.49 & @xmath184.07 & @xmath184.97 & 0.54 + & 15.54 & @xmath185.61 & @xmath183.68 & 0.46 + dr21w & @xmath189.57 & @xmath1818.45 & @xmath184.90 & 0.30 + & @xmath188.08 & @xmath1812.63 & @xmath185.54 & 0.43 + & @xmath187.78 & @xmath1813.23 & @xmath182.31 & 0.93 + & @xmath182.16 & 0.69 & @xmath182.44 & 24.60 + & @xmath181.21 & @xmath181.40 & @xmath182.44 & 82.29      the most striking feature of the masers in dr21(oh ) is the central region of the source , where numerous masers in all mapped transitions occur in an approximately elliptical structure ( figure  [ fig -

masers ] . \\n this feature is offset even farther to the east and south than the 229  ghz masers , with the caveat that it is difficult to determine the position of the 36  ghz maser accurately given the weakness of the maser and the 2  beamsize of the 36  ghz observations . \\n several class  i masers appear to the south ( 36 and 44  ghz ) and north ( 44  ghz only ) of the outflow . \\n unlike in the outflow , the 36  ghz masers in the south are usually not accompanied by cospatial 44  ghz masers . the northern and southern masers \\n are generally redshifted and blueshifted , respectively , compared to the bulk of the masers in the outflow , although not all masers conform to this pattern . \\n the southern masers are located closer to the sources dr21(oh)w , dr21(oh)s , and the ridge of ammonia emission connecting them ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) than to the outflow in dr21(oh ) , and therefore are unlikely to be associated with the main source driving the outflow in dr21(oh ) .      despite the detection of only 5 maser features , dr21w contains the brightest ( @xmath25  jy ) 36  ghz maser in our sample . \\n this maser is the only one for which we detect an antisymmetric stokes v profile ( figure  [ fig - zeeman ] ) , which will be discussed further in section  [ magnetic ] . \\n the bright masers near the origin in figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] are coincident with the 44  ghz masers detected by @xcite to better than a synthesized beamwidth . \\n the velocities of the 36  ghz masers near the origin agree with the velocities of the brightest nearby 44  ghz masers to within 0.2  kms@xmath2 or better . \\n dr21n was first identified as a 36  ghz maser source by @xcite . \\n we detect numerous 36  ghz masers in this source , mostly in the range from @xmath26 to @xmath27  kms@xmath2 , on the eastern side of the distribution of maser emission ( figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] ) . \\n several redshifted masers in the range @xmath28 to @xmath29  kms@xmath2 are found on the western side , along with one highly blueshifted maser ( @xmath30  kms@xmath2 ) . \\n all detected 229  ghz masers are found in close proximity to ( @xmath31 from ) a 36  ghz maser . \\n in contrast , no 44  ghz maser is seen within 1  of a 36  ghz maser . \\n as shown in figure  [ fig - zeeman ] , we detect an antisymmetric `` s - curve '' stokes v signature in the spectrum of the brightest maser in dr21w . \\n if interpreted as due to zeeman splitting , the implied line - of - sight magnetic field strength is @xmath32  mg , where @xmath33 represents the zeeman splitting coefficient ( assumed to be 1.7 hzmg@xmath2 for the 36  ghz transition by * ? ? ? \\n the direction of this component of the magnetic field would be oriented away from the observer . \\n the full three - dimensional field strength would presumably be larger , as zeeman splitting measures only the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field when the splitting between zeeman components is much less than the line width @xcite . \\n stokes v s - curves were not detected in any of the other maser sources , with a @xmath34 upper limit of @xmath35  mg in the brightest remaining maser in dr21(oh ) , although we note that a circular polarization fraction of @xmath36 ( i.e. , the v / i seen in dr21w ) would not produce a detectable ( @xmath37 ) stokes v signal in dr21(oh ) or in any of the weaker masers .    however , there is significant uncertainty in the zeeman splitting coefficient , which calls into question the direct zeeman interpretation of methanol stokes v s - curves . @xcite obtained a laboratory estimate of the land @xmath38-factor for the 25  ghz @xmath39 series of transitions of methanol , but the obtained value is an average over several different transitions and , in any case , may not be appropriate for the 36  ghz transition of methanol . @xcite and @xcite used the @xcite @xmath38-factor to estimate the zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7  ghz transition , and @xcite followed their method in deriving the zeeman splitting coefficient at 36  ghz . \\n a more recent look suggests that these calculations may have overestimated the zeeman splitting coefficients by an order of magnitude ( w.  h.  t.  vlemmings 2010 , private communication ) , which would serve to _ increase _ proportionally the putative magnetic field strengths reported from methanol zeeman splitting in this work and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) .    even if the @xcite zeeman splitting coefficient for the 36  ghz transition is ( approximately ) correct , a line - of - sight magnetic field strength of 58  mg is uncomfortably high . \\n measurements of the magnetic field strength are often used as a proxy for density . using a scaling of @xmath40 from the densities and magnetic fields of dr21 \\n would give a number density around @xmath41  @xmath42 @xcite , a value several orders of magnitude higher than that though to be suitable for 36  ghz maser excitation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n scaling from values typically found in oh masers instead ( a few milligauss , @xmath43  @xmath42 ; * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) results in density estimates well in excess of @xmath44  @xmath42 , which is still substantially larger than theoretical estimates ( but see also section 4.3 of * ? ? ? \\n the discrepancy between the implied density and theoretical calculations appropriate for class  i maser activity grows by two orders of magnitude if a smaller zeeman splitting factor is assumed ( w.  h.  t.  vlemmings 2010 , private communication ) . \\n if the zeeman interpretation is correct , one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the correlation between magnetic field strength and density does not hold in ( all ) the environments of class  i methanol masers , implying that the magnetic energy density is much greater than the kinetic energy density @xcite . \\n alternatively , it is possible that the high density implied by the large magnetic field is correct , and the bright 36  ghz maser in dr21w is produced via a pumping scheme not normally assumed for class  i masers . \\n typically , class  i masers are thought to be produced by collisional excitation followed by spontaneous cascade down to lower energy levels , with sink photons escaping or being absorbed by cold dust . \\n this mechanism has an upper limit for density , above which the inverted transition is thermalized by collisions . \\n one possible pumping mechanism at higher densities involves collisional excitation by a warm species and a collisional sink by a cooler species to produce the population inversion @xcite . \\n this mechanism requires a two - temperature mixture of particles , such as electrons ( and/or ions ) and neutrals , that may exist after the passage of a shock front . in principle \\n , such a collisional - collisional pump can operate at arbitrarily high density , as long as the temperature difference between the two species is sustained .    however , it is more probable that the stokes v signature we detect does not measure the magnetic field directly . \\n @xcite proposed a mechanism by which changes in the magnetic field orientation can convert linear polarization to circular polarization along the amplification path in a maser . \\n the stokes v signature produced by this mechanism can produce an s - curve that can mimic the effect of zeeman splitting of a much larger magnetic field . in the case of circumstellar sio masers that @xcite consider , \\n their proposed mechanism could operate with a magnetic field as weak as 0.1% of the magnetic field strength implied from interpreting the s - curve as purely due to zeeman splitting . \\n the @xcite mechanism requires that the zeeman splitting in units of frequency exceed both the stimulated emission rate and the decay rate appropriate for the masing transition , a condition likely to be satisfied for class  i methanol masers ( see section 4.2 of * ? ? ? \\n interestingly , dr21w ( this work ) and m8e @xcite , the two sources with detected zeeman splitting in the 36  ghz line , are also the two sources in which @xcite detected circular polarization in the 133  ghz ( @xmath45 ) transition . \\n future high - sensitivity observations at 133  ghz might permit detection of an s - curve signature in stokes v , thereby testing whether the magnetic field implied from a pure zeeman interpretation is consistent with the values derived at 36  ghz . \\n ( since the 36  ghz and 133  ghz methanol lines are both @xmath16 transitions , the same land @xmath38-factor would be applicable to each of them . ) \\n careful laboratory measurements of the zeeman splitting coefficients appropriate for the brightest methanol maser transitions would also be very helpful . \\n excitation models indicate that the physical conditions that are thought to produce inversion in class  i transitions usually lead to anti - inversion in class  ii transitions and vice versa @xcite . in that regard , the existence of class  i 36 and 229  ghz masers at the same velocity and location as the class  ii 6.7  ghz maser site is surprising . \\n these masers are also coincident with the brightest continuum emission near the outflow , which may be an important clue to their origin . \\n there is precedent for overlaps between class  i and class  ii methanol masers . @xcite \\n deduce spatial coincidences between the 6.7  ghz class  ii and 25  ghz @xmath46 series of class  i methanol masers in omc-1 , although the angular resolution of their interferometric observations is much poorer than either the 229  ghz data on which we report or the @xcite 6.7  ghz data . \\n @xcite model the 6.7/25  ghz overlap as arising from a lower - temperature regime than is typically assumed for class  ii masers . \\n this pumping model requires an intermixed environment of gas and dust at a lower temperature ( @xmath47  k ) than for traditional class  ii maser formation . the strong 226  ghz continuum emission in dr21(oh ) \\n likely marks such an environment that is rich in dust . \\n the @xcite model did not investigate excitation at 229  ghz , but it does predict inversion at 36  ghz , which is also a @xmath48 transition . \\n the model predicts that 44 and 95  ghz masers should _ not _ appear at a low - temperature 6.7  ghz maser site , since the former are @xmath17 transitions , while the latter is a @xmath49 transition . \\n indeed , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite do not report 44  ghz masers at this location .      in each of the sources we observed , the 36  ghz masers divide into two sets : those that are found to be cospatial with other class  i maser transitions , and those that are spatially isolated . \\n we address each of these two groups in turn .    in the outflow of dr21(oh ) and in the cluster in the north of dr21w \\n , we note that the distribution of the 36  ghz masers is similar to that of the 44 , 84 , 95 , and 229  ghz masers . \\n additionally , the brightest masers in all of these transitions appear in the same location . in dr21(oh ) , the brightest masers in all class  i transitions occur in a narrow velocity range ( @xmath50 to @xmath51  kms@xmath2 ) at the western tip of the outflow . \\n the next - brightest masers in each transition appear approximately 10  east of this position ( i.e. , 10  west of the origin in figure  [ fig - map - oh ] ) . \\n it is clear that these masers exist in a physical regime in which strong maser emission is produced in a large number of @xmath52 and @xmath17 transitions simultaneously . \\n the existence of a nearby energetic source creating an outflow likely shocks the surrounding molecular material , pumping multiple transitions of methanol in the same location . \\n on the other hand , all sources contain regions in which 36  ghz masers are not found to be coincident with other transitions . \\n for instance , numerous masers in both the 36 and 44  ghz masers are found to the south of the outflow in dr21(oh ) . \\n for the most part , the two transitions are not seen to be spatially coincident . \\n most of the 36  ghz masers and some of the 44  ghz masers in the south are seen near the periphery of cs emission @xcite . \\n the common feature of the environment of these masers is the lack of a nearby energetic source . as in the sagittarius  a region , it is possible that these masers trace molecular density clumps that are shock - excited by core collision or compression @xcite . \\n the 229  ghz masers appear to align more closely with the 44  ghz masers than with the 36  ghz masers in the dr21(oh ) outflow . \\n while 229  ghz masers are found to be coincident with 36  ghz masers on the western side of the outflow , there is always an accompanying 44  ghz maser . \\n in contrast , several 229  ghz masers appear coincident with 44  ghz masers but without 36  ghz emission , especially on the eastern side of the outflow . \\n however , we note several caveats about drawing conclusions from these points . \\n first , the angular resolution of the observations of both the 44  ghz and the 229  ghz masers is higher than that of the 36  ghz observations on which we report , and it is possible that more sensitive , higher - resolution observations of the 36  ghz masers will uncover other features at the sites of the 44/229  ghz overlaps . \\n second , every detected 229  ghz maser in dr21n appears near a 36  ghz maser site ( figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] ) . \\n third , at present the three dr21 sources on which we report are the only sources mapped in all three of the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz transitions , and the field of view encompassed by the 229  ghz observations in dr21(oh ) excludes nearly all of the masers south of the outflow as well as the eastern tip of the outflow itself . \\n this constitutes a rather small set of sources from which to draw general conclusions about the properties of the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz masers relative to each other . \\n more interferometric observations of both the 36 and 229  ghz transitions will be required to fully understand the phenomenology of either . \\n we have interferometrically imaged three sources in the 36 and 229  ghz class  i methanol maser lines . \\n we find numerous masers in both transitions and a diversity of conditions among them . \\n notably , we identify the following three environments , each of which may correspond to a different set of excitation conditions . \\n the outflow in dr21(oh ) contains a large number of overlaps in the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz transitions . \\n strong emission is also seen at 84 and 95  ghz , although there is a lack of high - resolution observations of these lines . \\n the brightest masers in all transitions appear at the same velocity and in the same location at the western tip of the outflow as traced by the masers . \\n the bright continuum source in dr21(oh ) is associated with both the class  ii 6.7  ghz masers and class  i 36 and 229  ghz @xmath53-type masers , but the class  i 44  ghz @xmath54-type masers are conspicuously absent . \\n this environment may be explained by the low - temperature intermixed dust and gas model of @xcite . \\n the 229  ghz transition produces detectable masers at a subset of the 36  ghz maser sites in dr21n . in both this source and in dr21(oh ) well south of the outflow , the 36 and 44  ghz masers have a similar large - scale distribution but are rarely found to produce a maser at the same site . \\n in addition , the brightest maser in dr21w produces an antisymmetric stokes v profile that implies a large magnetic field if interpreted as being due to zeeman splitting . \\n there is a very large uncertainty in the zeeman splitting coefficient appropriate for the 36  ghz transition , but the implied density ( assuming @xmath55 ) greatly exceeds the range over which class  i masers are thought to form . \\n it is possible that the circular polarization in this maser feature is produced by a much smaller magnetic field whose orientation changes over the amplification path of the maser @xcite . in any case , \\n careful laboratory measurement of zeeman splitting coefficients appropriate for methanol maser transitions is warranted given the increasing number of zeeman - like stokes v signatures identified in methanol transitions over the past few years .    in order to realize the goal of being able to identify the physical conditions in a variety of star - forming regions by the presence or absence of various methanol maser transitions \\n , it will be necessary to understand a few sources in greater detail . \\n our results highlight the need for both increased theoretical effort and more sensitive observations of multiple class  i transitions at higher angular resolution . \\n in particular , higher - resolution maps of the 84 and 95  ghz transitions as well as higher - frequency maser lines may be both enlightening and timely in the advent of the alma era . \\n a further survey of sources in the 36 and 229  ghz transitions , when combined with 44  ghz maps in the literature , may also be helpful in determining the range of possible methanol excitation conditions in nature . \\n t.  c.  m.  acknowledges support from the national science foundation s research experiences for undergraduates program . \\n the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation ( nsf ) operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc . \\n the submillimeter array is a joint project between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics and is funded by the smithsonian institution and the academia sinica . \\n we thank w.  h.  t.  vlemmings and a.  sarma for helpful discussions regarding methanol zeeman splitting coefficients . \\n sobolev , a.  m. , ostrovskii , a.  b. , kirsanova , m.  s. , shelemei , o.  v. , voronkov , m.  a. , & malyshev , a.  v.  2005 , in iau symp . \\n 227 , massive star birth : a crossroads of astrophysics , ed . \\n r.  cesaroni , m.  felli , e.  churchwell , & m.  walmsley ( cambridge : cambridge univ .  press ) , 174\", \"class  i methanol masers are believed to be produced in the shock -

disciplinary versatility of scientific publications and of their producers , and therefore to obtain a quantitative measure of their interdisciplinary scientific impact . \\n since the seminal work of de solla price  @xcite and garfield  @xcite , scientists have put a great effort into trying to understand the patterns of citation distributions  @xcite and the non - trivial dynamics of scientific recognition  @xcite . \\n this fundamental body of work has the ultimate goal of setting the basis for the definition of more accurate and fairer scientific impact metrics used for evaluation purposes .    in the last decades \\n , several indices have been presented . \\n they are based on the idea that we can quantify the impact of a scientific publication by counting the number of citations it has received over the years . \\n a widely adopted indicator to evaluate scholars scientific impact is the h -

layer adjacency tensor ) , then @xmath18 where @xmath19 indicates the rank@xmath8 tensor that represents the canonical basis in the space @xmath20 . \\n this is the general formulation of an adjacency tensor representing a multilayer network .    to build our network we consider @xmath21 nodes ( where @xmath22 is the number of publications , and @xmath23 the number of manufacturers of the chosen type that produced the @xmath22 papers \\n therefore , given the ordered set of nodes @xmath24 , the first @xmath22 elements @xmath25 represent publication , and the other @xmath23 elements @xmath26 represent manufacturers . \\n moreover , we consider @xmath27 layers , where @xmath28 is the number of scientific disciplines that the publications belong to . \\n the 4 components of the rank@xmath8 adjacency tensor @xmath29 are defined as follows . \\n @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 $ ] , encode information about publication citations . \\n each layer represents a discipline or a subfield , therefore @xmath33 if both publications @xmath34 and @xmath35 belong to discipline @xmath36 , and publication @xmath34 cites publication @xmath35 . \\n @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the number of disciplines that publication @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) belongs to . \\n this normalisation is performed so that every citation carries one unit of value overall . \\n interdisciplinary citations are instead encoded by @xmath31 ; @xmath39 if publications \\n @xmath34 belongs to discipline @xmath36 and @xmath35 to discipline @xmath40 , and publication @xmath34 cites publication @xmath35 . \\n let @xmath41 denote the remaining layer , then the tensors @xmath42 , with @xmath43 $ ] , encode information about the relation between publications and their manufacturers , _ \\n i.e. _ if the chosen type of manufacturer is scholars , then @xmath44 if author @xmath35 is one of the authors of publication @xmath34 . \\n if we consider research institutions , we connect each publication to the institutions to which its authors are affiliated ; if we consider countries , the connections are to the countries in which these institutions are based . finally , we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be zero tensors . \\n @xmath45 tensors are null because we do not want the relations between publications and manufacturers to be symmetric , to avoid unrealistic paths to take place when computing the nodes centrality . \\n @xmath46 is null because all the information is already encoded in the other tensors : we do not need to explicitly add citation edges between authors .    in this framework , for the citation layers , \\n each node is active on a given layer if and only if the publication it represents belongs to the corresponding field . \\n for example , a monodisciplinary publication is active only on one layer , whereas an interdisciplinary publication , pertaining to both physics and biology , is active on two layers . as a consequence , a publication \\n whose impact is restricted to only one discipline has intra - layer incoming edges only , whereas a publication that has influenced the work of researchers in more than one field has inter - layer incoming edges too , which represent the bridges between the different fields involved . \\n therefore this framework allows for a natural representation of the interdisciplinarity degree of a publication . \\n being our goal to rank publication producers too , we introduce in the network a second type of nodes , which , according to the specific need , represent scholars , inventors , research institutions , or countries . \\n these nodes are active on a dedicated layer , and each publication has directed outgoing inter - layer edges pointing to each of its producers . \\n previous works on ranking producers are based on one - mode projections of the bipartite network of publications and producers , whereas in this work we prefer to take advantage of the complete bipartite structure in order to avoid any information loss , as further detailed in the supplementary material .    on the proposed network \\n , the ranking is obtained through a process of diffusion of scientific credits from paper to paper through citation edges within and across disciplines . \\n producers are the sinks of this diffusion process , being represented by nodes with no outgoing edges , and incoming edges originated from the papers they have produced . \\n a schematic representation of the proposed network is shown in figure  [ explicative - figure ] . \\n having defined the multilayer citation network , we propose to rank its nodes according to their pagerank versatility , which is given by the steady - state solution of the equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the time - dependent tensor that gives the probability to find a random walker at a particular node @xmath49 in a particular layer @xmath50 , and @xmath51 \\\\mbox{,}\\\\ ] ] @xmath3 being the number of nodes in the network , @xmath4 the number of layers , and @xmath52 the teleportation rate . \\n @xmath53 denotes the rank@xmath5 tensor of transition probabilities for jumping between pairs of nodes and switching between pairs of layers , and @xmath54 is the rank@xmath5 tensor with all components equal to 1 . \\n let @xmath55 be the eigentensor of the transition tensor @xmath56 , denoting the steady - state probability to find a random walker in node @xmath49 and layer @xmath50 . \\n the tensor @xmath55 provides the pagerank of each node ( @xmath49 ) in each layer ( @xmath50 ) : it is crucial to remark here that this is not equivalent to calculate the pagerank in each layer separately , because our formulation accounts for the whole interconnected structure to solve the eigenvalue problem . to obtain the multilayer pagerank of each node , \\n regardless of the layer , we project the values obtained from its replicas in different layers , obtaining the multilayer pagerank vector @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vector with all components equal to 1 . \\n it has been shown  @xcite that this operation provides the same results that would be obtained by calculating pagerank by means of simulated random walkers that explore the multilayer structure according to transition rules encoded in @xmath56 . \\n to illustrate the proposed ranking method , we test it on two case studies : the american physical society ( aps ) and the us patents datasets .    the first is a collection of papers published in the journals of the american physical society ( physical review letters , physical review and review of modern physics ) between 1985 and 2009  . \\n we restricted the analysis only to papers with at most ten authors , to avoid biases due to the papers of experimental high - energy physics in which all the project collaborators are listed as co - authors . to disambiguate author s name \\n , we used a simple technique introduced in previous studies  @xcite . \\n meta - data in the dataset provide information about the topic of the papers through the specification of the assigned `` physics and astronomy classification scheme \\'\\' ( pacs ) code , developed by the american institute of physics ( aip ) and used in physical review since 1975 to identify fields and sub - fields of physics  . \\n we exploited this information to build a heterogeneous interconnected 10-layer network in which each layer represents a sub - field of physics , as defined by the pacs systems : _ general _ ; _ the physics of elementary particles and fields _ ; _ nuclear physics _ , _ atomic and molecular physics _ ; _ electromagnetism , optics , acoustics , heat transfer , classical mechanics , and fluid dynamics _ ; _ physics of gases , plasmas , and electric discharges _ ; _ condensed matter : structural , mechanical and thermal properties _ ; _ condensed matter : electronic structure , electrical , magnetic , and optical properties _ ; _ interdisciplinary physics and related areas of science and technology _ ; _ geophysics , astronomy , and astrophysics_. from the paper meta - data we also extracted the authors affiliation information , which allowed us to associate to each paper a list of ( one or more ) institutions and countries . \\n the final dataset consists of 319816 papers , 204809 authors , 626 institutions and 54 countries . \\n arguably , the aps dataset covers only physics , but note that physics is a vast field that spans from biological physics to astrophysics and although it may fall short of a full interdisciplinary analysis it is clear that this is a powerful indicator of multi - topic analysis that serves to proof the usefulness of the method . \\n the second dataset contains the u.s . \\n patents granted between january 1963 and december 1999 , and all citations made to these patents between 1975 and 1999  . to define the layers \\n , we used the 6 categories proposed in previous studies  @xcite : _ chemical ( excluding drugs ) _ ; _ computers and communications _ ; _ drugs and medical _ ; _ electrical and electronics _ ; _ mechanical _ ; _ others_. each patent is assigned to one main class defined by the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , and to any number of subsidiary classes . \\n each class belongs to one of the listed categories , therefore each patent is associated with one or more layer according to its classes . \\n however , the dataset only contains the information about the main class , therefore we complemented it by extracting the information about the other classes from the uspto patent grant full text  . \\n the final dataset contains 1574882 patents , 1142499 inventors , 138833 assignees ( i.e. corporations for the most part ) , and 127 countries . \\n figure  2 shows the evolution of the interdisciplinary ranking of the world top physics departments , and of the world top companies , over time . this visualization allows to observe , for instance , the raise of the university of texas at austin during the 1990s , after the establishment , in 1985 , of the center for nonlinear dynamics , funded and directed by the boltzmann medal laureate harry swinney  . \\n compared to previously proposed algorithms of diffusion of scientific credit , the proposed method rewards researchers that have carried out interdisciplinary works or have had an impact in different scientific areas . to show this , we first compare it with the science author rank algorithm ( sara )  @xcite . \\n we find that the rankings of aps authors obtained using sara and using the proposed method have a spearman s rank correlation of 0.77 ( @xmath59 confidence level ) . \\n the high value of correlation is to be expected since both methods rank researchers simulating a diffusion process on a citation network . \\n however , the proposed method gives higher ranking to versatile researchers such as the self - organised criticality pioneer per bak ( + 21 positions gained ) , econophysics co - founder eugene stanley ( + 56 ) , complex networks pioneer shlomo havlin ( + 104 ) , and complex systems professor leonard m. sander ( + 93 ) . \\n we show that the proposed method is in fact able to capture two fundamental aspects of interdisciplinary research : intrinsic multidisciplinarity ( i.e. publishing papers or patents pertaining to different areas ) on the one hand , and effective interdisciplinarity , i.e. being credited by different scientific areas , on the other . \\n we define the _ topical interdisciplinarity _ \\n @xmath60 of an author @xmath2 ( who could be a scholar or an inventor ) as the average number of different scientific areas her / his publications pertain to , i.e. : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of publications authored by @xmath2 , and @xmath63 is the number of fields that publication @xmath64 belongs to . \\n moreover , for each publication @xmath65 we define an entropy metrics based on the distribution of its incoming citations across the different fields represented by the different layers : @xmath66 where the sum is over the different fields ( layers ) and @xmath67 is the proportion of edges incident in @xmath65 that come from layer @xmath34 . therefore if a publication is only cited by other publications belonging to its own field @xmath68 , \\n whereas a publication that has received citations from different fields has @xmath69 , and the higher the number of fields it has had impact on , the higher its entropy . for each author @xmath2 we then compute her / his _ citation interdisciplinarity _ @xmath70 as the average entropy of her / his publications : @xmath71    we find a strong positive correlation between the gain in rank that scholars and inventors obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and their topical interdisciplinarity ( figure  3 , panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) . \\n moreover , we find that the rank gain is also positively correlated with the disciplinary diversity of scholars and inventors incoming citations ( figure  3 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . to control for the effects of productivity , i.e. the fact that a researcher that produces more papers has more chances to publish in more areas or to be cited by papers in many different areas , we perform the same analysis on two subsets of the data by considering in each case only authors with a fixed number of publications ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) . \\n the correlation coefficients found in these subsets are consistent with those found using the whole dataset , demonstrating that the proposed method is not biased by productivity . \\n the results are reported in the supplementary material . \\n coefficient , and setting the statistical significance at @xmath74 . \\n solid lines represent density gradient contours , and dashed lines represent linear regression models estimated via maximum -

citations  @xcite , the choice of the appropriate citation time window  @xcite , field normalisation  @xcite , and author credit allocation  @xcite . despite the vast literature on the subject \\n , consensus is still lacking on how to solve these issues . here , we propose a method whose objective is to account for interdisciplinarity , and we do not enter those debates . \\n however , the bipartite interconnected multilayer networks of citations and disciplines that we introduce can be adapted to take into account specific needs . \\n for example , edges connecting papers to their authors could be weighted differently to take into account non - homogeneous allocation of credit , or a specific time window could be chosen a priori to select the papers constituting the network . \\n going beyond the presented assessment of the benefits produced by interdisciplinarity , the method proposed in this work could constitute a tool for funding agencies and academic hiring decision makers to quantify the impact of interdisciplinary research and its producers , for a faster advancement of excellent science . \\n a.a . , e.o . and m.d.d . \\n acknowledge financial support by the spanish government through grant fis2015 -

mode projection .    for the sake of simplicity \\n , we will consider a bilayer version of the network . \\n our focus here is not in fact the multilayer aspect of the network capturing interdisciplinarity , but rather its bipartition . \\n therefore , let us consider @xmath75 nodes and 2 layers @xmath76 . \\n the 4 components of the rank@xmath8 adjacency tensor @xmath29 are now defined as follows . \\n @xmath77 encodes information about citing relations between papers , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 if paper @xmath34 cites paper @xmath35 . \\n @xmath79 encodes information about paper authorship , _ i.e. _ @xmath80 if author @xmath35 is one of the authors of paper @xmath34 . finally , we define @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be zero tensors , consistently with the representation introduced in s.1 . for the sake of simplicity , since in the rest of the section we will be dealing only with rank-2 tensors , we will make use of the simpler classical matrix notation instead of the tensorial one . therefore we will denote @xmath77 as @xmath83 and @xmath79 as @xmath84 . in the author citation network proposed in @xcite , \\n each node represents an author , and @xmath85 if there exist at least one publication @xmath49 , of which @xmath34 is an author , that cites a publication @xmath86 of which @xmath35 is an author . \\n each such publication gives a contribution @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the number of authors of publication @xmath49 , and @xmath90 is the number of authors of @xmath86 ) so that the total contribution of each citation is equal to 1 . \\n let us consider an adjacency matrix @xmath91 of size @xmath92 , encoding the citation links between papers . \\n @xmath83 can be built from @xmath91 by means of multiplication with a rectangular matrix @xmath93 of size @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and all the other elements are equal to 0 . \\n then @xmath97 using @xmath93 we can also build @xmath84 from the projection matrix @xmath98 , of size @xmath99 , where @xmath100 if @xmath35 is one of the authors of paper @xmath34 : @xmath101 let us define @xmath102 as the normalised version of @xmath98 , _ \\n i.e. _ @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is the number of authors of paper @xmath34 ) , then the @xmath105 adjacency matrix representing the network of citations between authors can be obtained performing two successive matrix multiplications : @xmath106 _ proof : _ @xmath107 \\n this means that @xmath108 is a sum over the papers authored by @xmath34 that cite paper @xmath109 , where each paper @xmath0 gives a contribution of 1 over the number of authors . \\n then : @xmath110 each element @xmath111 is therefore a sum over all the pairs of papers @xmath112 such that @xmath34 is an author of @xmath0 and @xmath35 of @xmath109 , and each element of the sum gives a contribution equal to @xmath113 , as indeed defined in @xcite . \\n @xmath114    we have demonstrated that the adjacency matrix of the author citation network is obtained performing two operations of matrix multiplication involving @xmath91 and @xmath98 . \\n matrix multiplications consists in multiplications and summations of the matrix elements , which inevitably lead to information loss . \\n the supra - adjacency matrix of the network proposed in this paper is instead the sum of the two expansions of @xmath91 and @xmath98 , _ i.e. _ @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . \\n this guarantees that no information is loss , and this why we chose to consider the whole bipartite structure . \\n figure [ toy - model-1 ] shows an example in which the information loss characteristic of the author citation network leads to a less fair ranking of authors compared to the ranking based on the network introduced in this paper . using our approach ( top figure ) \\n , the most central author is @xmath115 , who is the author of both the most central paper and of one of the second most central papers . \\n however , in the author citation network framework , the most central author is @xmath84 ( to understand why , we recall that the pagerank centrality is based not only on the number of incoming edges , but on the importance of the nodes from which these edges originate ) . \\n this is due to the fact that in the author citation network all the information about an author s incoming citations from different papers is aggregated , and therefore @xmath84 benefits from the importance of @xmath115 without any distinction between the importance coming from papers that actually cite @xmath84 , and that coming from @xmath115 s other papers . in this case @xmath115 \\n s most central ( and cited ) paper is not the one citing @xmath84 s paper , but this information is lost in the author citation network . as a consequence , the resulting ranking does not always reflect the real importance of the different authors . \\n an alternative approach is to use the pagerank method to get the centrality of papers in @xmath91 , and then compute the author centrality as a properly normalised sum of the centralities of the papers she / he has authored . in matrix terms , the author pagerank centrality vector @xmath116 can be obtained by simply applying a linear transformation to the paper pagerank centrality vector @xmath117 : @xmath118 however , this solution involves another kind of aggregation which can lead to misleading results too . \\n an example is shown in figure [ toy - model-2 ] . using the sum approach , \\n author @xmath119 becomes more central than author @xmath84 , because she / he authored two papers , even though they are the two most marginal papers in the network ( note that the only citation to paper 4 is a self - citation ) . on the contrary , @xmath84 is the author of a very central paper , and in fact our approach correctly classifies her / him as more central than @xmath119 . \\n the issue with this alternative approach is that the pagerank is a diffusion process , which is not a linear dynamics . \\n therefore summing over the centralities of different nodes is also an aggregation process through which some information on the system is lost . \\n in figure  3 of the main text , we show that we find a strong positive correlation between the gain in rank that scholars and inventors obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and their topical interdisciplinarity ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) . \\n moreover , we show that the rank gain is also positively correlated with the disciplinary diversity of scholars and inventors incoming citations ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . to control for the effects of productivity , i.e. the fact that a researcher that has produces more papers has more chances to publishes in more areas or to be cited by papers in many different areas , we perform the same analysis on two subsets of the data by considering in each case only authors with a fixed number of publications . figure  [ control_20papers ] shows the result for the subset of authors and inventors with @xmath72 publications , and figure  [ control_50papers ] for authors and inventors with @xmath73 publications \\n . the results are consistent with those obtained using the whole dataset . \\n publications obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and two measures of their interdisciplinarity level . \\n the x -

optic phenomena is the kerr effect , which appears in reflection from a magnetic medium . in this case , also within the voigt geometry , the kerr angle and ellipticity are defined as @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the total complex reflection amplitudes ( with multiple scattering taken into account ) for right and left circular polarized light . \\n note that the simple relations , @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 $ ] , @xcite obtained in the thick -

recording devices . \\n @xcite the behavior as a function of free carrier hole concentration can be seen in fig . \\n [ faraday_x6 ] where the faraday rotation angle is shown for several carrier concentrations . \\n the peaks and valleys in the different quantities are present in all the concentrations , however the magnitude varies , even changing sign at several concentrations and frequencies .     mn concentration with @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath108.,width=326 ]    rather than presenting many different graphs for all the possible parameters ( @xmath111,@xmath112 , etc . ) , we direct the reader to a data - base located at http://unix12.fzu.cz/ms , where results for these quantities , together with other physical quantities , can be obtained and plotted vs. different nominal parameters.@xcite \\n we have presented a theory of the ac hall effect in the infrared regime by extending the berry s phase theory of the dc - anomalous hall effect to finite frequencies and treating the effects of disorder through a finite lifetime of the valence - band quasiparticles . \\n we observe features ( peaks and valleys ) in the transverse conductivity in the range between 200 and 400 mev at which the conductivity changes by more than 100% . \\n we have studied how these features appear in different magneto - optical effects ( mcd , faraday rotation and kerr effect ) which are relatively easily measured , finding strong signals . \\n the magnitude of the faraday rotation is very large ( one order of magnitude larger than that observed in paramagnetic ( ii , mn)vi s for example ) and has a nontrivial dependence on the free carrier concentration . \\n the kerr effect is also strong when compared to materials used in magneto - optic recording . \\n the origin of the peaks is most easily understood within a simple 4-band spherical model in which transitions between heavy and light holes states with opposite spin - polarization give the strongest contribution to the anomalous transverse optical conductivity . \\n the four band model represents the infinite spin - orbit coupling strength limit of the six - band model we use for numerical calculations . \\n our use of a six - band model can account only for transitions within the valence band and not for transitions between conduction and valence bands . \\n because of this limitation , we can not address the crossover between intra - band and interband contributions which are not completely separated in these extremely heavily - doped semiconductors , something that is clearly desirable and should be addressed in subsequent theoretical work . \\n our predictions depend in intricate detail on the model that we have used to describe the ferromagnetism of these materials . \\n the model depends most essentially on the assumption that the mn impurities act as reasonably shallow acceptors and introduce @xmath2 local moment degrees of freedom to the system . \\n the specific calculations presented here assume that mn impurities and other scatterers in the system can be treated perturbatively . \\n this assumption enables quasiparticle scattering rates to be estimated in a simple way , but is a less essential part of the model . \\n the magneto - optical properties studied here are directly dependent on valence - band spin - orbit coupling , which we have argued elsewhere @xcite plays an essential role in understanding ferromagnetism in these materials . \\n confirmation by future experiment of the detailed predictions made here for the magneto - optical properties of these materials would further validate the approach we have taken to modeling these interesting new ferromagnets . \\n we expect that the weak - quasiparticle - scattering approximations made here will be more reliable in more metallic samples , since the scattering rates are then smaller compared to other relevant energy scales , particularly the fermi energy . \\n we hope that these calculations will help motivate magneto - optic experiments in the infrared regime for ( ga , mn)as and other ( iii , mn)v ferromagnets . \\n the authors gratefully acknowledge stimulating conversations with d. basov , b. gallagher , t. dietl , and q. niu . \\n this work was supported by the welch foundation , by the office of naval research under grant n000140010951 , and by the grant agency of the czech republic under grant 202/02/0912 . \\n we present in this appendix the details involved in deriving the results shown in eqs . \\n [ sig_4b]-[tildedelta ] for the anomalous contribution to the ac hall conductivity calculated first in the exchange field within the 4-band spherical model . \\n the host valence band hamiltonian in this case , as shown in sec . \\n [ 4band ] , is given by @xmath113,\\\\ ] ] the eigenspinors of @xmath114 are given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the spinors with the axis of quantization along the z -

hernquist & ostriker 1992 ; kandrup et al . \\n 1992 ; pfenniger 1993 ; pfenniger & friedli 1993 ; gurzadyan & pfenniger 1994 ; romeo 1994 , hereafter paper i ; byrd 1995 ; gerber 1996 ; merritt 1996 ;

palou et al . \\n 1993 ; shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) . in particular , the alternatives proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) and pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) reflect an interesting idea , viz . \\n that softening should be as localized as possible since there is no clear reason for modifying the gravitational interaction at long distances , and it is tempting to explore its dynamical consequences . from a more general point of view , this and the following extensions provide the tools for comparing experiments that employ different types of softened gravity . \\n we investigate the implications of our stability analysis for the classical relaxation problem ( rybicki 1972 ;

miller 1970 ) , cubic - spline softening ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) and homogeneous - sphere softening ( pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) ; hereafter abbreviated to p , cs and hs , respectively . \\n each name means that the softened point - mass potential can be viewed as the newtonian potential generated by a spherical mass distribution of that type ( but the force is evaluated regarding the test particle as a point mass ) . in the following discussion \\n we do not refer to this finite - sized particle interpretation of softening , unless otherwise specified . \\n the behaviours of these types of softened gravity are shown in fig .  2 ( left ) . in p \\n the gravitational interaction is softened mainly at short distances and the newtonian behaviour is recovered asymptotically , whereas in cs and hs softening is perfectly localized , i.e.beyond a certain cut - off distance the gravitational interaction is identically newtonian . the form in which localization is implemented differs in the two types . \\n in particular , cs has a rather soft cut - off at @xmath156 , @xmath1 being the nominal softening length , whereas hs has a sharper cut - off at @xmath157 . \\n the results of the dynamical comparison are presented in fig \\n .  3 ( left ) and table 1 ( top ) , which are discussed below , and in figs .  4 ( left ) and 5 . \\n useful analytical formulae are reported in appendix a.    figure 3 ( left ) shows that the effective scale height @xmath33 varies significantly with softening type , but apart from that the stability properties are analogous on scales larger than @xmath158 . \\n this can be shown by rescaling @xmath10 in terms of @xmath159 and noting that @xmath18 is similar in the three types for @xmath160 . for @xmath161 , @xmath162 changes sign and starts to oscillate , in contrast to @xmath163 . \\n an analogous behaviour occurs in @xmath164 , but is less noticeable . \\n negative values of @xmath18 mean that a given surface - density perturbation is in phase with the induced potential perturbation and , correspondingly , that the contribution of self - gravity to the dispersion relation is stabilizing . \\n however , this feature does not affect the stability properties on scales comparable to the inverse of the typical radial wavenumber , since @xmath18 changes sign well beyond the critical point @xmath165 [ cf . \\n table 1 ( top ) ] . \\n the related oscillations of @xmath18 mean that in certain ranges of @xmath27 noise is suppressed more effectively on larger than smaller scales , and correspond to oscillations of the short - wave branch of the dispersion relation . \\n on the other hand , this feature has not significant consequences for the relaxation properties , because the corrected optimal relaxation level @xmath166 is approximately the same as in p [ cf . \\n table 1 ( top ) ] . \\n table 1 ( top ) shows that the stability and relaxation characteristics vary significantly with softening type . \\n the largest variations occur between hs and p , concern @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and are up to a factor of 3 . \\n in contrast , the corrected optimal relaxation level @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 remain approximately constant . \\n the variations between hs and cs are within 20% .      as a second application of our method \\n , we consider an anisotropic generalization of hs , the family of homogeneous - ellipsoid softening ( pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) , and compare the dynamical effects of two representative spheroidal members : one oblate with @xmath172 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 being the planar and vertical softening semi - axes , and the other prolate with @xmath173 ; hereafter abbreviated to hos and hps , respectively . regarding @xmath125 as the softening length of reference \\n , @xmath174 gives a measure of softening anisotropy . \\n the behaviours of these types of softened gravity are shown in fig .  2 ( right ) . \\n anisotropy is implemented in a form consistent with the finite - sized particle interpretation of softening , i.e.  through a spheroidal deformation of the field particle . \\n this mainly corresponds to a spheroidal transformation of the surface on which the force peaks , but it also strongly influences the behaviour in the plane . \\n in particular , the degree of softening localization , the sharpness and magnitude of the force peak differ from those in hs [ cf.fig .  2 ( left ) ] , and are higher in hos than hps . \\n so a 2-d analysis is required even though the isotropic case has already been investigated . \\n the results of the dynamical comparison are presented in fig .  3 ( right ) and table 1 ( bottom ) , which are discussed below , and in fig .  4 ( right ) . \\n the major points are then generalized in the final discussion . \\n useful analytical formulae are reported in appendix a.    figure 3 ( right ) shows that , for @xmath175 , @xmath176 is concave , in contrast to @xmath177 . \\n the transition behaviour occurs in @xmath178 [ cf . \\n fig .  3 ( left ) ] . \\n concavity of @xmath18 mainly means that softening has a stronger tendency to cause artificial stabilization for a given effective scale height @xmath33 , for we know that the reduction factor of 3-d discs with newtonian gravity is convex ( cf.paper i , fig .  1 ) . \\n in fact , hos does not mimic the effect of thickness for realistically large values of @xmath33 , since the safety threshold for approximate physical consistency @xmath179 and the optimal value @xmath180 are ill - defined [ cf . \\n table 1 ( bottom ) ] . \\n concavity of @xmath18 also means that softening causes a moderate degree of ` redshift ' . for @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath177 \\n become analogous to @xmath183 , and analogous conclusions can be drawn concerning the stability and relaxation properties . \\n table 1 ( bottom ) shows that the stability and relaxation characteristics differ considerably in the two types . \\n the major qualitative differences concern @xmath168 and @xmath170 , and have been pointed out above [ cf . \\n discussion of fig .  3 ( right ) ] . \\n excluding @xmath167 , which has a restricted range of applicability in hos , the largest variation concerns @xmath80 and is beyond half an order of magnitude . \\n in contrast , note the low sensitivity of the corrected optimal relaxation level @xmath184 , which remains roughly constant . \\n finally , instead of comparing those results with the isotropic case , let us clarify the dynamical relations between _ all _ the spheroidal members of the family of homogeneous - ellipsoid softening and the standard type of softened gravity [ cf . \\n table 1 ( top ) ] .    1 . \\n a general feature of the spheroidal members is that @xmath33 is determined by @xmath126 alone : @xmath185 . \\n this is not intuitive since a more natural softening length in the plane is expected to be @xmath125 . \\n 2 .   all the oblate members with @xmath186 have an ill - defined @xmath179 , i.e.  @xmath187 , and thus differ fundamentally from p ( cf . \\n 3 .   as @xmath174 increases , \\n such a difference becomes progressively less important ( cf . \\n hs and hps ) . \\n indeed , the prolate member with @xmath188 , i.e.  @xmath189 , turns out to be hardly distinguishable from p. ( values of @xmath190 are not employed in simulations . ) \\n modelling gravity is a fundamental problem that must be tackled in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar systems , and satisfactory solutions require a deep understanding of the dynamical effects of softening . \\n this problem has deserved special attention both in the past ( e.g. , miller 1970 , 1976 ) and in more recent times ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .  1985 ; hernquist & katz 1989 ; pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) . \\n viewed in this general perspective , our contribution has a threefold practical importance in addition to the points emphasized in sect .  1 .    1 .   the two present applications of our method reveal the dynamical differences between the most representative types of softened gravity : the isotropic p , cs and hs ( abbreviated as in sect . \\n 3.1 ) , and the anisotropic hos and hps ( abbreviated as in sect . \\n the major conclusions concerning their dynamical resolution , i.e.  their faithfulness in simulating the newtonian dynamics , are summarized below . 1 . \\n as regards the isotropic types , the dynamical resolution is comparable . \\n this results from the fact that , even though the spatial resolution and the effectiveness in reducing noise differ significantly in p , cs and hs for the same nominal softening length @xmath1 , those differences can largely be removed by considering a more appropriate softening length of reference . \\n as regards the anisotropic types , the dynamical resolution is significantly coupled parallel and perpendicular to the plane . in the plane , it decreases in quality from hps to hos , and the transition occurs in the oblate members for a softening axial ratio @xmath191 ( hps is dynamically similar to p ) . \\n these disadvantages result from the finite - sized particle implementation of softening anisotropy . on the other hand \\n , they have less importance than the advantage of introducing such a degree of freedom into 3-d simulations of disc galaxies , which has been emphasized by pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) and in our method . \\n 3 .   last but not least , when employing these types of softened gravity in simulations of disc galaxies , we should recall that the dynamical resolution depends _ critically _ on two quantities : @xmath1 , or @xmath125 for a given @xmath174 , and the safronov - toomre parameter @xmath65 ( cf . \\n paper i ) . \\n the choice of @xmath1 or @xmath125 should be checked vs.  the profiles of the characteristic values @xmath192 , @xmath179 and @xmath193 , which are tabulated in the applications . the choice of @xmath65 should be checked vs.  the profiles of the stability threshold @xmath66 and level @xmath194 , which can be evaluated as is explained in the method . \\n our method can be applied for testing new ideas about softening . \\n there are two features that encourage such future applications \\n one is the _ unified _ approach adopted for investigating stability , relaxation and equilibrium . as a result , full information about the dynamical effects of softening is contained in a single quantity : the reduction factor @xmath18 . \\n 2 .   the other is the _ modular _ structure of the method . \\n we describe step by step how to extract detailed information concerning the dynamical properties , starting from @xmath18 and pointing out the quantities of major interest . \\n 3 .   but our method can be applied in another , more fruitful , way : for developing new ideas about softening . indeed , it opens a _ direct _ route to the discovery of optimal types of softened gravity for given dynamical requirements , and thus to the accomplishment of a physically consistent modelling even in the presence of a cold interstellar gaseous component \\n . such a future application will be the objective of a ` twin ' paper . \\n this paper is dedicated to my parents francesco and grazia . \\n it is a great pleasure to thank the referee , daniel pfenniger , whose papers about softening have represented an invaluable source of inspiration for both developing and maturing my ideas . in addition , i am very grateful to francoise combes and lars hernquist for strong encouragement and valuable suggestions on a previous draft of this paper . \\n i am also very grateful to john black , daniel friedli , cathy horellou , henry kandrup , richard miller , juan muzzio , masafumi noguchi and jan palou for strong encouragement and useful discussions . the financial support of the swedish natural science research council is greatly appreciated . \\n @xmath195                      aarseth s.j . , 1963 , \\n mnras 126 , \\n 223 abramowitz m. , stegun i.a . , 1972 , handbook of mathematical functions  with formulas , graphs , and mathematical tables . \\n dover , new york bender c.m . \\n , orszag s.a . , 1978 , advanced mathematical methods for scientists and engineers . \\n mcgraw -

to - date status report ) . \\n the dynamics is described in terms of transition amplitudes between states belonging to the kinematical hilbert space of lqg . in particular , \\n when the spin - network basis is used , the transition amplitude is a function of spins and intertwiners associated to the links and the nodes of the spin - network graph . in the recent literature @xcite , spinfoams are generally defined in terms of these variables : a space - time configuration in the spinfoam sum is understood as a @xmath0-complex with faces labeled by @xmath1-spins and edges labeled by @xmath1-intertwiners . \\n different representations of the hilbert space of lqg can be lifted to the covariant level in spinfoams . in this paper \\n we consider two representations for spinfoams . \\n the first is a _ \\n holonomy representation_. this representation allows to write spinfoams into a form closer to a feynman path - integral : as an integral over the ashtekar connection smeared along links that slice faces of the spinfoam @xmath0-complex . \\n the second is the _ \\n holomorphic representation _ \\n : it is based on the segal - bargmann transform for theories of connections introduced by ashtekar , lewandowski , marolf , mouro and thiemann @xcite . \\n clearly , spinfoams in different representations have the same physical content . \\n what the new representations provide is new insights and new calculational tools . in particular , \\n the holomorphic representation offers a new way of understanding the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams . \\n the holomorphic representation is associated to coherent spin - network states @xcite,@xcite . \\n these states are peaked on a classical intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic discrete geometry of space . \\n this fact has a remarkable consequence that we discuss below . \\n recently , the large scale asymptotics of the @xmath2 spinfoam vertex has been derived @xcite . \\n the analysis has been done using the representation in terms of spins and normals introduced by livine and speziale @xcite . for a geometric set of boundary data , the asymptotics of the lorentzian \\n vertex features a sum over two classical solutions . \\n this leads to a cosine of regge action , similarly to what happens in @xmath3d for the ponzano - regge model . \\n we argue that the presence of the second undesired classical solution in the semiclassical expansion is an artifact of the representation used : the representation in terms of spins and normals diagonalizes the area operator ; as a result , it has a maximal spread on its conjugate momentum and can not completely identify a point in phase space . on the other hand , \\n the holomorphic representation discussed in this paper is based on coherent spin - networks . \\n these states are peaked both on the area and on its conjugate variable , an extrinsic angle . \\n this is enough to select one of the two classical solutions in the semiclassical expansion . \\n the paper is organized as follows . in section \\n i we discuss the holonomy representation of spinfoams and its relation with the two representations mostly used in the literature : the ` spin and intertwiner ' representation and the ` spin and normals ' representation . \\n then , in section ii , we introduce the holomorphic representation as the segal - bargmann transform of the holonomy representation . \\n moreover we discuss the interpretation of the complex variables used in terms of discrete classical geometries . in sections \\n iii and iv , we derive the expression of the euclidean and the lorentzian spinfoam vertex both in the holonomy and in the holomorphic representation . in section \\n v , we discuss an application of the derived formulae : we show how the peakedness on the extrinsic geometry allows to select a single classical solution in the analysis of the large scale asymptotics of the lorentzian spinfoam vertex . \\n in lqg , the hilbert space associated to a graph @xmath4 embedded in a 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of links of the graph and @xmath8 the number of nodes . in the ` holonomy representation ' , \\n a state is a gauge invariant function of @xmath1 group elements @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) that is invariant under @xmath1 gauge transformations at nodes , @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the node that is source / target of the link @xmath14 . the configuration variables @xmath15 are interpreted as holonomies of the ashtekar -

kernel on @xmath1 , @xmath67 as shown in @xcite , coherent spin - networks provide a segal - bargmann transform for loop quantum gravity . given a state @xmath68 , \\n its scalar product with a coherent spin - network @xmath69 defines a function @xmath70 that is holomorphic in @xmath62 , @xmath71 and belongs to the hilbert space @xmath72 of holomorphic functions normalizable with respect to a measure @xmath73 ( see @xcite and the appendix of @xcite for details , where @xmath74 is the haar measure on @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is just the heat - kernel on @xmath77 , regarded as a @xmath1-invariant function on @xmath75 . ] ) . \\n this result is based on the seminal work of hall @xcite . \\n moreover the @xmath63 labels @xmath62 provide a parametrization of the phase space of the theory as captured by a graph . \\n the peakedness properties of these states and their geometrical interpretation in terms of classical holonomies and fluxes is well - studied within loop quantum gravity @xcite . \\n however their use in spinfoams has remained largely unexplored until recently @xcite . in the following \\n we show how coherent spin - networks and the associated holomorphic representation can be fruitfully used in the spinfoam setting . \\n a spinfoam vertex can be expressed in the holomorphic representation using formula ( [ eq : wpsi ] ) , @xmath78 as an example , the ponzano - regge vertex amplitude ( [ eq : pr h ] ) in the holomorphic representation is given by the following formula : @xmath79 the advantage of using the holomorphic representation is that the @xmath63 labels admit a clear interpretation in terms of classical discrete geometries . here \\n we discuss two equivalent descriptions of the discrete geometry associated to the @xmath63 variables : the first ( a ) is the one proper of canonical lqg and is due to sahlmann - thiemann - winkler @xcite , the second ( b ) is the one mostly used in the covariant spinfoam setting , it is in terms of freidel - speziale variables for twisted geometries @xcite and has been introduced by the authors in @xcite . \\n \\\\(a ) let @xmath5 be the boundary @xmath3-manifold and choose a classical configuration of the ashtekar connection @xmath80 and its conjugate momentum , the electric field @xmath46 . \\n moreover , let @xmath81 be a cellular decomposition of @xmath5 and @xmath4 a graph dual to this decomposition . \\n the flux of the electric field through a face @xmath82 of @xmath81 determines a @xmath83 algebra element @xmath84 . \\n the holonomy of the connection along a link @xmath14 of the graph @xmath4 determines a @xmath1 group element @xmath85 . \\n the set of couples @xmath86 , one per link of the graph , determines a point in a truncation of the phase space of general relativity as captured by the graph @xmath4 . \\n the couple @xmath86 can be written as an element of the complexification of @xmath1 using the polar decomposition in front of @xmath87 is required in order to have the correct interpretation of the @xmath75 variables in terms of classical fluxes and holonomies , as a careful analysis of the expectation values of geometric operators elucidate . on the expecation values of elementary operators , see @xcite . \\n ] of @xmath63 : @xmath88 this is the cartan decomposition of a lorentz transformation into an @xmath1 rotation and a boost . \\n coherent spin - networks with labels as in ( [ eq : complexification ] ) are peaked on the classical configuration @xmath86 . \\n \\\\(b ) let @xmath81 be a cellular decomposition of the boundary @xmath3-manifold @xmath5 ( the cells of the decomposition can be simplicial or even polyhedral ) . \\n equip separately each cell with a euclidean @xmath3-geometry . as a result , \\n the shape of each cell is fixed and the area and the normals to its faces can be computed . \\n now we consider two cells that share a face , and require that the area of the face is the same when seen from either of the two cells . therefore , for each face @xmath82 of @xmath81 \\n , we have as variables its area @xmath89 and two normals @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in general the geometry these data determine is twisted in the sense of @xcite . \\n a special case is the one where shared faces have congruent shapes . in this case , a continuous piecewise - flat geometry is obtained . in the case of a simplicial decomposition \\n , this is a regge geometry @xcite .    besides areas and @xmath3-normals \\n , there is another quantity of interest . \\n let us consider two cells sharing a face @xmath82 and think them as embedded in @xmath21-dimensional minkowski space . \\n we call @xmath92 and @xmath93 the @xmath21-normals to the two cells . \\n their scalar product determines an angle @xmath94 with the meaning of extrinsic curvature , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the minkowski metric . \\n we call @xmath97 the extrinsic angle times the immirzi parameter codes the rotation generated by the extrinsic curvature term @xmath98 of ashtekar - barbero connection . ] \\n @xmath99 , @xmath100 summarizing , for each link of the graph @xmath4 dual to @xmath81 , we have the following set of variables :    - an area @xmath101 ,    - an _ extrinsic _ angle @xmath97 ,    - two unit - normals @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    out of these variables \\n we can build a @xmath63 element @xmath62 given by the following expression @xmath102 where the complex number @xmath103 is given in terms of @xmath97 and @xmath104 by @xmath105 and @xmath52 is the @xmath1 element associated to a vector @xmath50 as explained in the footnote@xmath106 . \\n the reason for this parametrization is that coherent spin - networks ( [ eq : coherent spin - networks ] ) with @xmath63 labels specified as in ( [ eq : hl ] ) , for large area @xmath104 reduce to superpositions over spins of livine - speziale spin - networks ( [ eq : ls spin - network ] ) @xcite . \\n moreover , the superposition over spins is a gaussian centered in @xmath107 times a phase term @xmath108 . \\n this is the superposition originally proposed by rovelli in the analysis of the graviton propagator @xcite . \\n the interpretation of the @xmath63 labels in terms of twisted geometries will be important in section v where we discuss the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams . \\n the relation between the description in terms of fluxes and holonomies ( a ) and the description in terms of areas , angles and normals ( b ) can be easily derived . writing ( [ eq : hl ] ) as the polar decomposition @xmath109 we recognize the variables used in ( [ eq : complexification ] ) , @xmath110 \\n the 4d spinfoam vertex amplitude @xcite is generally defined in terms of its components on a spin - network basis . in the euclidean case , for immirzi parameter @xmath111 , \\n it is given by @xmath112 with @xmath113 , @xmath114 the @xmath115-symbol for @xmath116 and the fusion coefficients @xmath117 defined in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . \\n this representation has been used in numerical investigations @xcite . contracting it with the spin - network basis ( [ eq : spin - network ] ) leads to a rather simple integral formula for the vertex in the holonomy representation . \\n let @xmath118 be a map from the representation @xmath119 of @xmath1 to the representation @xmath120 of the euclidean group @xmath121 . \\n the map @xmath118 is such that it commutes with the diagonal action of @xmath1 on @xmath116 . in the canonical basis , \\n the map @xmath118 is given by clebsh - gordan coefficients @xmath122 notice that @xmath123 , therefore the map @xmath118 corresponds to a projection to the highest weight representation in the tensor product @xmath124 . using this map , the vertex amplitude in the holonomy representation can be written as @xmath125 the integrals on @xmath126 impose the euclidean invariance of the vertex , and the integrand is given by a product of ` face ' terms @xmath127 given by the following distribution over @xmath128 : @xmath129 expression ( [ eq : w hl ] ) can be easily put in the holomorphic representation using the segal - bargamann transform @xcite : @xmath130 where @xmath131 notice that the last expression can be seen as a distribution on @xmath132 . \\n in this section we discuss the definition of the 4d lorentzian vertex @xcite and derive its holonomy and its holomorphic representation . \\n let @xmath133 be a gauge invariant state on a graph bounding the spinfoam vertex @xmath134 the 4d lorentzian vertex amplitude for this state is obtained in two steps :    * we map the @xmath1-boundary state @xmath133 into a @xmath63-boundary state @xmath135 using a ( @xmath99 dependent ) map @xmath30 defined below ; * we impose lorentz invariance at nodes . \\n this provides a compact definition of the vertex amplitude as has to be gauge - fixed in order to avoid having a divergent expression @xcite . ] \\n @xmath136 the eprl - fk vertex corresponds to a specific choice of @xmath30 defined as follows . \\n let us consider the principal series of unitary irreducible representations @xmath137 of @xmath63 @xcite with casimir operators given by @xmath138 they decompose into irreducible representations @xmath139 of a subgroup @xmath1 as @xmath140 consider the representation with labels @xmath141 , @xmath142 and let @xmath118 be the embedding of @xmath143 into the lowest weight representation of @xmath144 . \\n calling @xmath145 its canonical basis , the map @xmath118 is given by @xmath146 now we define the map @xmath147 in terms of @xmath118 as follows . \\n given the state ( [ eq : bstate ] ) , we have @xmath148 the fact that @xmath149 is square - integrable follows easily from the ortogonality of the wigner matrices in the principal series ( on the definition and finiteness properties of @xmath75 spin - networks , see @xcite ) . using the definition ( [ eq : wvpsi]),([eq : f ] ) of the lorentzian vertex , it is easy to derive its holonomy representation . \\n let @xmath150 be the @xmath1 gauge invariant delta function on the boundary graph @xmath151 its vertex amplitude provides the holonomy representation of the lorentzian vertex . \\n it is given by the following integral expression @xmath152 where the integral is over @xmath153 and the ` face ' term is @xmath154 similarly to what happens in the euclidean case . \\n its segal - bargmann transform corresponds to the vertex amplitude of a coherent spin - network . \\n it is given by @xmath155 where the ` face ' term now is @xmath156 we report also the ` spin and normals ' representation of the lorentzian vertex @xmath157 this expression is the one used in the analysis of the asymptotics of the vertex @xcite . in next section \\n we uncover an interesting interplay of the representations ( [ eq : lor h ] ) and ( [ eq : lor normals ] ) of the spinfoam vertex in the analysis of its semiclassical behavior . \\n the holomorphic representation is associated to a set of states that have semiclassical properties . \\n this fact makes the holomorphic representation the appropriate tool for studying the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams . \\n we illustrate this point using a simple quantum mechanical system , and then discuss it in the case of the 4d lorentzian vertex amplitude . \\n let us consider a particle on a line . \\n the evolution operator in the position representation is given by @xmath158\\\\;e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}s[x(t ) ] } , \\\\label{eq : w(x_1,x_2)}\\\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is the hamiltonian operator for the particle , @xmath160 the evolution time , and @xmath161 $ ] the classical action . \\n in the formal semiclassical limit @xmath162 , the path integral in ( [ eq : w(x_1,x_2 ) ] ) is dominated by classical solutions @xmath163 starting at @xmath164 and ending at @xmath165 . \\n there can be more than a single classical solution and the stationary phase approximation of the path integral is given by a sum over all classical contributions @xcite @xmath166 here @xmath167 $ ] is the hamilton function , that is the action evaluated on one of the classical solutions . \\n @xmath168 is a slowly varying function of @xmath164 and @xmath165 . \\n notice that , if we expand the hamilton function around the points @xmath169 and @xmath170 , the linear terms in the expansion are proportional to the initial and final momenta . \\n in fact the derivatives of the hamilton function are @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the initial and final momenta of the classical solution @xmath174 . \\n this fact has two important consequences :    * let us consider a gaussian wave packet peaked at the initial position @xmath175 and initial momentum @xmath176 , and study its evolution with the dynamics ( [ eq : w(x_1,x_2 ) ] ) . in the @xmath162 limit , only one of the terms in the sum over classical solutions in ( [ eq : h to 0 ] ) \\n contributes to its evolution . \\n specifically , the term that contributes is the exponential of the hamilton function for the classical solution @xmath177 that has @xmath178 as initial conditions . * the transition amplitude to a gaussian wave packet that is peaked at a final position @xmath179 and final momentum @xmath180 \\n is suppressed unless these are the final position and momentum of the classical solution @xmath177 that has @xmath178 as initial conditions . \\n these two facts make the holomorphic representation especially well - suited for the analysis of the semiclassical behavior of the dynamics . \\n the holomorphic representation for a particle on a line is associated with coherent states given by the analytic continuation in @xmath181 of the heat - kernel on a line @xmath182 when @xmath181 is continued to the complex number @xmath183 , the state @xmath184 is peaked both on the position @xmath185 of the particle _ and _ on its momentum @xmath186 . \\n in fact the state has a phase term @xmath187 coding the peakedness on the momentum , @xmath188 the holomorphic representation of the evolution operator is @xmath189 we call the couple @xmath190 _ classical _ if it corresponds to the boundary conditions of a classical solution @xmath177 of the dynamics . in the @xmath162 limit \\n , the transition amplitude @xmath191 is maximized when the couple @xmath192 corresponds to a classical solution . \\n otherwise , if @xmath192 is not classical , a rapidly oscillating term @xmath193 appears in the integral ( [ eq : kwk ] ) with the effect that the transition amplitude @xmath191 is suppressed .    to summarize : the feature of the holomorphic representation is that at most one classical trajectory contributes to the semiclassical expansion of the transition amplitude . \\n a similar phenomenon happens in spinfoams . \\n + let us consider the lorentzian spinfoam vertex ( [ eq : lor h ] ) and focus on the case of a graph @xmath4 dual to the boundary of a @xmath21-simplex as originally done in @xcite . \\n the amplitude @xmath194 depends on ten elements of @xmath63 , one per link of the graph . \\n we can parametrize them in terms of twisted geometries using the variables @xmath195 , as explained in section ii . \\n the semiclassical limit @xmath162 corresponds to the large area asymptotics , @xmath196 . in the following , \\n we discuss the large area asymptotics of @xmath194 . \\n notice that the large @xmath104 asymptotics of @xmath197 is proportional to the projector to the highest magnetic number @xmath198 . as shown in @xcite , a consequence of this fact \\n is that the large area asymptotics of @xmath62 in the definition of coherent spin - networks reproduces a gaussian with a phase on spins , times bloch coherent states : @xmath199 when gauge invariance at nodes is imposed , bloch coherent states intertwine and reproduce livine - speziale states . as a result \\n , the large area asymptotics of the spinfoam vertex in the holomorphic representation is given by the vertex in the ` spin and normals ' representation ( [ eq : lor normals ] ) , summed over spins with a gaussian weight times a phase in spins : @xmath200 now we consider the sum over spins . \\n the gaussian in the second line of ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) is peaked on a large value of the spins , @xmath201 . as a result , \\n if we want to estimate the sum over spins , it is enough to know the large spin behavior of the quantity @xmath202 . \\n this quantity has been studied in detail by barrett - dowdall - fairbairn - hellmann - pereira @xcite . \\n we briefly recall their results . \\n they compute the large spin asyptotics of the 4d lorentzian vertex in the spins - normals representation ( [ eq : lor normals ] ) . \\n the result found is the following :    \\\\(i ) when the spins and the normals identify the geometry of the boundary of a @xmath21-simplex in 4d minkowski space , the asymptotics gets two contributions : @xmath203 each contribution features a rapidly oscillating phase term given by the regge action for discrete gravity @xcite , @xmath204 this is the action for a single @xmath21-simplex with faces of area @xmath205 , extrinsic angle @xmath94 , and a given choice of parity . \\n \\\\(ii ) on the other hand , if the boundary data @xmath206 do not identify the edge lengths of a @xmath21-simplex but give only a twisted geometry , then the vertex amplitude is exponentially suppressed .    the two semiclassical contributions @xmath207 in ( [ eq : barrett ] ) \\n correspond to parity - reversed classical solutions . \\n we argue here that the appearence of a sum over classical solutions in the asymptotics of @xmath202 is exactly analogous to what happens in the simpler case discussed at the beginning of this section ( [ eq : h to 0 ] ) : it is due to the fact that the ` spin and normals ' representation does not identify a point in phase space . \\n let us see now what happens in the holomorphic representation ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) when we use the result ( [ eq : barrett ] ) . \\n our boundary data now are not just areas and normals @xmath208 , there are also the angles @xmath97 that are conjugate to the areas . \\n let us assume that the areas and the normals are compatible with the edge - lengths of a @xmath21-simplex is . ] . plugging ( [ eq : barrett ] ) into ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) we have @xmath209 in the sum over spins there is now a rapidly oscillating phase term @xmath210 analogously to expression ( [ eq : p ] ) , \\n the quantity @xmath211 is the momentum computed out of regge action for given boundary data : @xmath212 therefore the sum over spins is suppressed unless the variable @xmath97 in the boundary data is chosen to coincide with @xmath213 or @xmath214 . in either case , only one of the two classical solutions contributes to the semiclassical behavior of the vertex . \\n in this paper we have introduced a holomorphic representation for spinfoams . \\n the 4d spinfoam vertex for gravity has a rather elegant expression in this representation : it is given by formula ( [ eq : weprl h],[eq : p h ] ) in the euclidean case and by ( [ eq : lor h],[faceterm ] ) in the lorentzian case . \\n this new representation is obtained introducing first a holonomy representation and then computing its segal - bargmann transform . \\n a spinfoam amplitude in the holomorphic representation is a function @xmath215 of @xmath63 elements @xmath62 , one per link of the boundary graph @xmath4 . \\n the set of variables @xmath62 describe a truncation of the phase space of general relativity as captured by the graph @xmath4 . \\n they admit a parametrization in terms of the variables generally used for describing the classical boundary geometry of a spinfoam configuration : ( i ) 3-normals to faces of a cellular decomposition of space , ( ii ) the area of faces , ( iii ) an angle associated to faces that measures the extrinsic curvature at the interface of two cells . \\n these data describe the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the boundary and can be coded into @xmath63 elements @xmath62 via equation ( [ eq : hl ] ) . \\n therefore , we have a description of spinfoams in terms of variables with a clear geometrical meaning \\n .    the holomorphic representation of spinfoams can be fruitfully used for analyzing their semiclassical behavior . in section \\n v , we focused on a spinfoam vertex in the holomorphic representation and showed that a single exponential of the regge action contributes to the large scale asymptotics . \\n what selects one of the two exponentials appearing in the `` spin and normals '' representation is the peakedness of the boundary state on a prescribed extrinsic curvature . \\n it is important to understand if this feature extends beyond the single vertex level . a way to attack \\n the problem is to derive an action in holomorphic variables following the method introduced in @xcite and then checking if a mechanism of cancellation of phases as proposed in @xcite is at work . \\n finally , we suggest a way to use the holomorphic representation to make a bridge with the hamiltonian framework . \\n roughly , let us consider a holomorphic transition amplitude ( propagation kernel ) @xmath216 between an initial state labeled by complex variables @xmath217 and a final state labeled by @xmath218 . \\n suppose there is a differential operator @xmath219 acting on either the initial or the final variables which annihilates the amplitude : @xmath220 the previous equation can then be interpreted as the wheeler - dewitt equation for pure gravity satisfied by the propagation kernel in the holomorphic representation . \\n a recent result @xcite in the context of spinfoam cosmology shows that the holomorphic amplitude for a transition between two homogeneous metrics is , in a suitable approximation , in the kernel of a differential operator which is ( the quantization of ) the friedmann - robertson - walker hamiltonian in the absence of matter . \\n we find this result encouraging and it urges us to further explore this line of research . \\n we thank frank hellmann , roberto pereira and carlo rovelli for helpful discussions . the work of e.b . is supported by a marie curie intra -

It is found that lane changes', 'recently , driven diffusive systems have attracted the interests of physicists because the systems show surprisingly rich and complex behavior.@xcite as a simple model of driven diffusive systems , asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( aseps ) have been widely studied in chemistry and physics.@xcite moreover , aseps have been applied successfully in biology such as gel electrophoresis,@xcite protein synthesis,@xcite mrna translation phenomena,@xcite motion of molecular motors along the cytoskeletal filaments,@xcite and the depolymerization of microtubules by special enzymes@xcite as well as vehicular traffic.@xcite    a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is regarded as the minimal model of aseps , in which particles move along one direction . \\n tasep has received much attention in modeling intra - cellular molecular transport and related traffic problems@xcite in recent years . \\n macdonald et al.@xcite initially used a tasep to simulate the dynamics of ribosomes moving along messenger rna chains . \\n kruse and sekimoto@xcite proposed a two - headed tasep model to describe molecular motor traffic . in their model , each motor consists of two heads and each head is attached to a filament . \\n each filament is assumed to be moveable . \\n the investigation indicates that the average relative velocity of filaments is a non - monotonic function of the concentration of motors . the density and current profiles of motors with different types of microtubule tracks ( e.g. , cylindrical geometry and radial geometry ) have been investigated by lipowsky et al.@xcite    an extension of single - lane tasep , incorporating langmuir kinetics ( lk , the attachment and detachment of particles ) , has been presented by parmeggiani et al.@xcite their model is also referred to as the pff model . \\n numerical results of the pff model show that there are unexpected stationary regimes for large but finite systems . \\n such regimes are represented by phase coexistence in both low and high density regions , which are separated by a domain wall . \\n a model , incorporating a tasep , langmuir kinetics and brownian ratchet mechanism,@xcite is proposed by nishinari et al.@xcite to mimic the movement of the single - headed kinesin motor , kif1a . \\n a novel feature in their model is that there are _ three _ states ( strong binding , weak binding and no binding ) of a kif1a , compared to _ two _ states ( binding or unbinding ) in previous models . \\n their model can capture explicitly the effects of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) hydrolysis as well as the ratchet mechanism which drives individual motors . \\n the experimentally observed single molecular properties in the low - density limit are reproduced and a phase diagram is presented .    most previous work on modeling molecular motor traffic deals with single - lane systems where particles can move forward or backward , or attach and detach to a bulk ( a collection of sites in a lane except boundaries ) . obviously , the description of the traffic of motors would be more realistic if multi - lane asymmetric exclusion processes can be considered . \\n experimental observations@xcite have found that motor protein kinesins can move along parallel protofilaments of microtubules and they can jump between these protofilaments without restraint . \\n recently , pronina and kolomeisky@xcite proposed a two - lane traffic model to simulate a tasep with symmetric lane - changing rules between two lanes , but without langmuir kinetics . \\n the computational results suggest that lane - changing rates have a strong effect on the steady - state properties of the system . \\n in particular , the particle current of each lane will decrease and particle densities will increase with the increase of particle coupling . \\n pronina and kolomeisky then extended their model to a more general case where asymmetric coupling is applied.@xcite it is found that asymmetric coupling between lanes leads to a very complex phase diagram , quite different from symmetric coupling . \\n there are seven phases in the tasep with asymmetric lane - changing rates , in contrast to three phases found in the system with symmetric coupling . \\n in addition , a new maximal - current phase with a domain wall in the intermediate coupling is reported in ref.@xcite    effects of synchronization of kinks ( i.e. , domain walls ) in a two - lane tasep without langmuir kinetics is investigated by mitsudo and hayakawa.@xcite the asymmetric lane - changing rate between lanes is used . moreover , \\n different injection and ejection rates of particles at the boundaries of two lanes are also considered . \\n the positions of kinks are reported to be synchronized , though the number of particles may be different on these two lanes . \\n more recently , jiang et al.@xcite introduced langmuir kinetics into one lane of a two - lane system . \\n this has shown that synchronization of shocks on both lanes occurs when the lane - changing rate exceeds a threshold . \\n a boundary layer is also observed at the left boundary as a finite - size effect . in their model , \\n attachment and detachment of particles are assumed to occur only on one of two lanes , not both , which is unable to realistically describe real two - lane or multi - lane molecular motor traffic . \\n this paper will investigate the collective effect of attaching and detaching particles on both lanes of a two - lane system with symmetric inter - lane coupling . \\n in particular , we will focus on the finite - size effects of the system . \\n the model described in this paper is directly motivated by the dynamics of molecular motors , for instance , unidirectional motion of molecular motors along filaments,@xcite random motor ( e.g. , kinesin ) attachments and detachments to filaments,@xcite and molecular motors freely changing to adjacent filaments.@xcite it is expected that the incorporated process of a tasep , langmuir kinetics and lane - changing can shed light on the study of the traffic of molecular motors and other particle traffic in biology as well as in other areas such as vehicular traffic .    we investigate the effects of the following parameters on density and current profiles : ( i ) different lane - changing rates @xmath1 . \\n we denote @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is used to represent the number of lane - changing particles and @xmath4 is the length of each lane ( i.e. , the number of cells in each lane ) ; ( ii ) different combinations of attachment ( @xmath5 ) and detachment ( @xmath6 ) rates ( for simplicity , we assume that attachment rate @xmath7 is fixed but detachment rate @xmath8 varies ) ; and ( iii ) different system size @xmath4 , i.e. , the length of each lane . note that as we only consider symmetric lane changing , these two lanes are equivalent . \\n we compare results obtained from our model when @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where the two - lane system becomes two separated taseps coupled with langmuir kinetics ) . in this way \\n , we can more clearly distinguish the effect of different values of @xmath3 on a two - lane system . \\n finally , mean - field approximation ( mfa ) is presented and used to verify our monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) . \\n the paper is organized as follows . in section \\n ii , we give a description of our two - lane tasep model , considering attachment and detachment of particles in both lanes . in section iii \\n , we present and discuss the results of our monte carlo simulations . in section iv , \\n mean - field approximation is presented and the quantitative agreement between the monte carlo simulations and the mean - field theory is confirmed . finally , we give our conclusions in section v. \\n our model is defined in a two - lane lattice of @xmath11 sites , where @xmath4 is the length of a lane . \\n we assume that all particles move from the left to the right , as shown in fig . \\n 1 . sites @xmath12 = 1 and @xmath12 = @xmath4 define the left and right boundaries respectively , while a set of sites @xmath12 = 2 , ... , \\n @xmath13 is referred to as a bulk . \\n particles in the system are involved in the following processes : lane selection , particle injection into the first site of a lane , particle detachment from a bulk , particle movement along a bulk , particle lane - changing between bulks , particle attachment to a bulk , and particle ejection from the last site of a lane . \\n thus , we assume that a particle that is injected to a lane and moves along the lane may be involved in the following processes :    * lane selection : a lane is randomly chosen . \\n * particle injection : if the first site of the selected lane is unoccupied , a particle will be injected to the site with probability @xmath14 . * \\n particle detachment : a particle can leave the system with probability @xmath15 . \\n * particle movement : if a particle can not leave the system , it can move forward to the next site in the same lane provided that the next site is empty . if the next site is not empty , the particle can not advance . in this case , the particle will check if it can change to the other lane . * \\n particle lane - changing : the particle may change to the corresponding site on the other lane with probability @xmath1 if the corresponding site on the other lane is unoccupied . * \\n particle attachment : if a site in a bulk is empty , a particle can attach to the site with probability @xmath16 . * \\n particle ejection : if a particle reaches the last site of a lane , it will be ejected from the system with probability @xmath17 . \\n the above processes can be described using the following updating rules . \\n as the two lanes are equivalent , they have the same updating rules . \\n we only list the updating rules for lane 2 . an occupation variable ( @xmath18 ) \\n denotes the state of the @xmath12th site in the @xmath19th lane , where @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) corresponds to whether the site is occupied ( or empty ) . \\n thus , @xmath22 refers to the state of site @xmath12 on lane 2 . \\n the rules are :    * case @xmath23 . \\n ( i ) if @xmath24 , a particle enters the system with probability @xmath14 ; ( ii ) if @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the particle in the site of @xmath27 moves into site @xmath28 ; ( iii ) if @xmath25 and @xmath29 , then the particle in the site of @xmath27 stays there . \\n no lane change occurs . * \\n case @xmath30 . \\n if @xmath31 , the particle leaves the system with probability @xmath17 . no lane change occurs . \\n * case @xmath32 . \\n ( i ) if @xmath33 , the particle may leave the system with probability @xmath15 ; if it can not leave the system , it moves into site @xmath34 provided @xmath35 . \\n if the particle can not advance , it may change to lane 1 with probability @xmath1 if @xmath36 ; ( ii ) if @xmath37 , a particle enters the system with probability @xmath16 . \\n these updating rules for both lanes are illustrated in fig . \\n 1 . for simplicity \\n , we use a symmetric lane - changing rule . \\n it will be the next step of our work to investigate the effects of asymmetric lane - changing rates on the dynamics of interacting particles .    normally , there are three types of updating schemes:@xcite ( i ) in parallel . \\n updating rules are synchronously applied to all sites . \\n a typical application is in vehicular traffic flow ; ( ii ) in ordered sequence . \\n positions of particles are updated in an ordered sequential manner , e.g. , from one end to the other end of a one - dimensional system ; ( iii ) in random . \\n a site is randomly chosen and it is updated according to updating rules . \\n here we use a randomly sequential updating scheme , i.e. , the third scheme , which has been widely used in the simulations of molecular motor traffic.@xcite \\n in this section , the results of monte carlo simulations are presented . \\n the average current ( @xmath38 ) is given by : @xmath38 = @xmath39(1 - @xmath40 . \\n the parameters are set to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath7=@xmath46*@xmath8 . in simulations , \\n stationary profiles are obtained by averaging @xmath47 samples at each site . \\n the sampling time interval is @xmath48 . \\n the first @xmath49 time steps are discarded to let the transient time out . \\n for the special case when @xmath50 , the two - lane process is reduced to two separated processes : two one - lane tasep with langmuir kinetics . \\n features of a one - lane tasep with langmuir kinetics have been well studied in ref.@xcite    fig . \\n 2 shows average density @xmath51 and current @xmath52 of one lane of a two - lane system for different values of @xmath3 . for the special case @xmath10 \\n , the two - lane system reduces to two separated single - lane systems . \\n when @xmath3 increases from 0 to 1 , we may expect the domain wall always moves in one direction ( either to the left or right ) . however , an unexpected phenomenon has been observed in our simulations : the domain wall first moves to the left slightly , and then moves towards the right with the increase of @xmath3 ( see figs . \\n 2(a ) and ( b ) ) . \\n this process is more clearly captured in figs . \\n 3(a ) and ( b ) , where the domain walls for @xmath53 are shown . \\n one can see that the domain wall moves to the left first when @xmath3 increases from 0 to 0.2 , and then moves towards the right when @xmath54 . \\n we refer to this feature as the _ jumping effect _ to describe the domain wall ( as well as current curve ) jump to the left and then to the right caused by the particles jumping between the two lanes . \\n we also find that there is a critical value , @xmath55 , to distinguish the movement direction of the domain wall under certain conditions . \\n a similar effect occurs in ref.@xcite    when @xmath7 and @xmath8 increase proportionally , the jumping effect becomes weaker ( comparing figs . \\n 2(a ) and ( b)with figs . \\n 4(a ) and ( b ) ) . \\n this implies that the jumping effect is also influenced by attachment and detachment rates . \\n the jumping effect is also observed in a larger system , e.g. , @xmath56 , ( see fig . \\n 5 ) when @xmath3 is small . \\n it can be seen that the domain wall moves left when @xmath57 . \\n when @xmath58 , the domain wall moves right . \\n for instance , there is an obvious movement towards right when @xmath59 ( see fig . \\n the critical value @xmath60 of @xmath3 varies with a system size , i.e. , @xmath60 changes from 0.2 to 0.3 when the system size increases from 1,000 to 10,000 . \\n we have also confirmed that the jumping effect in a two - lane homogeneous tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics is a kind of finite - size effect . \\n when the system size is very large , e.g. , @xmath61 , in our simulations , the jumping effect almost disappears . \\n we argue that we need to study and examine finite - size effects , like the jumping effect because the size of a real system is normally not very large . \\n for example , kinesin protein motors are responsible for long - distance transport in a cell . \\n the length that a kinesin protein motor travels from its origin to its destination is normally about 100 successive steps on microtubules and the step size of kinesins is about 8nm.@xcite this indicates that a system size below 1,000 is enough to realistically describe the movements of molecular motors . even for a large system , a size @xmath62 is normally adequate for simulation . \\n thus , a conclusion obtained based on the assumption of an infinite size may not be applicable to any real system .    comparing figs . \\n 2(a ) and ( b ) with figs . \\n 4(a ) and ( b ) , it can be seen that the slopes of domain walls increase with the increase of @xmath7 and @xmath8 proportionally . \\n this is because when the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 enlarges , more particles will attach to these two lanes rather than detach from them . \\n increasing the value of @xmath3 means more particles have chances to change to the other lane if they can not move forward along the current lane . upon further increasing @xmath3 , it is found that the density decreases , and the locations of shocks shift right slightly ( see figs . \\n 2(a ) and 3(a ) ) . \\n when @xmath63 ( @xmath64 denotes the position where the density reaches maximum ) , the differences between density profiles are not obvious ( see figs . 2 and 4 ) \\n this suggests that lane - changing rate @xmath3 does not have any obvious effect on the system properties ( e.g. , average density and current profiles ) after the maximum density is reached .    in figs . \\n 2(c ) and ( d ) , and 4(c ) and ( d ) , current profiles are illustrated . \\n it is found that ( i ) the current decreases with the increase of @xmath3 until it approaches the maximum current ( @xmath65 ) . \\n when @xmath66 is approximately equal to @xmath39 , the current @xmath67 @xmath39(1 - @xmath68 . \\n thus , the maximum current @xmath69 0.25 . \\n we denote by @xmath70 the position where the current reaches the maximum ; ( ii ) when @xmath71 , the current increases when lane - changing rate @xmath3 increases ; ( iii ) when @xmath72 , the current profiles are almost the same for different @xmath3 . \\n we next investigate the effect of the values of @xmath46 ( @xmath73/@xmath8 ) on average density and current profiles . \\n we consider the situation in which @xmath7 is fixed but @xmath8 varies . \\n note that the increase of @xmath46 means the decrease of @xmath8 . \\n it can be seen that average density increases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 ( see fig . \\n moreover , the shock moves left and the amplitude increases . \\n in other words , the width of the transition region decreases . \\n this may be explained as follows : when the value of @xmath46 increases , the value of @xmath8 decreases proportionally , so that the opportunities for particles to detach from the bulk become smaller . \\n in this case , more particles will remain in the bulk . \\n this leads to an increase of average density .    in fig . \\n 6(b ) , the current first increases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 till it reaches the maximum value , and then the current decreases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 . in other words , \\n the position with the maximum current moves left and the amplitude increases ( see fig . \\n 6(b ) ) upon increasing @xmath46 . \\n the current curves can be obtained from equation @xmath38 = @xmath39(1 - @xmath40 , it thus can be seen that the maximum current @xmath65 = 0.25 when densities of two adjacent sites are equal to 0.5 . \\n when density is higher or lower than 0.5 , the corresponding current is lower than 0.25 . \\n fig . 7 shows the density and current profiles for different system sizes . \\n it is found that the width of the transition region decreases as the number of sites is increased ( see fig . \\n our simulation suggests the boundary layer shows a finite - size effect and will disappear in the limit of an infinite system . the finite - size effect shown in fig . \\n 7(a ) is consistent with that in refs.@xcite in fig . \\n 7(b ) one observes the amplitude in the left boundary enhances when the system size increases . \\n in this section , a mean - field theory is developed . \\n the occupation variable ( @xmath18 ) defined in section ii is also used . \\n the corresponding equation for the evolution of particle densities @xmath74 in a bulk ( i.e. , @xmath75 can be written as    @xmath76    @xmath77    where @xmath78 denotes a statistical average . \\n the term @xmath79 is the average current from site @xmath12 in lane 1 to site @xmath12 in lane 2 , while @xmath80 is the average current from site @xmath12 in lane 2 to site @xmath12 in lane 1 . \\n the first two terms in eqs . \\n ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) correspond to particle movement ; the middle two terms correspond to particle lane changing , and the last two terms correspond to attachment and detachment of particles . at the boundaries , the densities evolve as @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath19 can be 1 or 2 . \\n it can be seen that eqs . \\n ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are equivalent when we use the same lane - changing rate between two lanes . \\n therefore , we only focus on the mean - field approximation in lane 2 ( i.e. , eq . \\n when @xmath4 is large , i.e. , @xmath83 , we can transfer the coarse - grained stationary - state eq . \\n ( 2 ) to continuum mean - field approximation . \\n first , we factorize correlation functions by replacing @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then we set @xmath88    substituting ( [ m5 ] ) into eq . \\n ( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the term @xmath94 is replaced by @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is approximated as @xmath97 ; similarly , the term @xmath98 is replaced by @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is approximated as @xmath101 . \\n the boundary conditions become @xmath102 and @xmath103 . as \\n lane -

fock diagram subsumes lccsd diagrams @xmath93 from ref . \\n @xcite , so that these diagrams are to be discarded in the present approach . \\n we postpone discussion of numerical results until section  [ sec : numerics ] . \\n in this section we continue with the systematic dressing of the coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements based on the topological structure of the product @xmath0 , eq .  . \\n here we focus on the two - body term of this object . \\n the insertion that generates the rpa - like chain of diagrams is due to a two - particle / two - hole part of the object @xmath94 , @xmath95 where we used a symmetry property @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . \\n an analysis identical to that presented for line dressing in section  [ sec : particlehole ] leads us to introducing an rpa - dressed object @xmath98 , @xmath99 where subscript rpa specifies that the objects inside the brackets are to be contracted so that the result has the same free particle / hole ends as the original bare object @xmath100 , eq .  . \\n the sign of the leading term ( with the kronecker symbols ) is chosen in such a way that a product of this term with a particle - hole object like @xmath101 results in the original object . \\n a detailed consideration leads to an implicit equation for the rpa - dressed particle - hole insertion @xmath102 this equation , presented graphically in fig . \\n [ fig : rpadressingeqn ] , can be solved iteratively .    , while the bare object @xmath103 is represented by a wavy line . \\n [ fig : rpadressingeqn ] ]    the resulting insertion @xmath98 may dress any particle - hole vertex of a diagram as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : rpadressingvertex ] .    . \\n [ fig : rpadressingvertex ] ]    as an example , consider dressing of particle - hole matrix elements of operator @xmath10 : @xmath104 . \\n the equation for the dressed matrix element @xmath105 may be derived simply as @xmath106 where we used eq .   for the dressed object @xmath107 . \\n finally we obtain a set of two equations @xmath108 the resulting equations resemble the traditional rpa formulae for dressed matrix elements ( see , e.g. , ref . \\n @xcite ) , but do not couple @xmath109 and @xmath110 . \\n in addition , the role of the residual coulomb interaction of the traditional rpa formulae is played by the matrix elements of @xmath111 object ( that is dominated by second order in the coulomb interaction , see section  [ sec : iv ] ) . \\n in addition , we would like to emphasize that the line - dressed matrix elements , eq \\n .   also include matrix elements between core and virtual orbitals ; these are to be distinguished from the rpa - like matrix elements , eq .  . \\n the above derivation is only valid when dressing a single isolated vertex . \\n more complex situation arises whenever a horizontal cross - cut through a diagram produces several ( not just two , as in fig .  [ fig : rpadressingvertex ] ) unquenched particle and hole lines . \\n then the lower particle and hole lines of the object @xmath111 could be attached to the unquenched lines of the bare diagram in any order and `` cross - dressing \\'\\' may occur . as an illustration , \\n consider rpa - dressing of the valence double contribution to the wavefunction @xmath112 . \\n it arises , for example , when the diagram @xmath113 ( see fig . \\n [ fig : zsdrepresentative](a ) ) is cut across horizontally . \\n the valence double contains two equivalent vertexes @xmath114 and @xmath115 . \\n first we may attach the rpa object to the @xmath116 vertex and at the second step to the @xmath117 vertex . \\n apparently , this scenario is not covered by eq . \\n , since it implies that all rpa insertions are attached to the same vertex . \\n nevertheless , the rpa - like dressing can be carried out in a straightforward fashion . to continue with the illustration , the rpa - dressed valence double amplitude \\n may be defined as follows ( compare to eq .   ) \\n @xmath118 \\\\times \\\\right . \\n \\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\ & & \\\\left . \\n \\\\sum_{mna } \\\\rho_{mnva } a^\\\\dagger_m a^\\\\dagger_n a_a \\\\right)_\\\\mathrm{val . \\n double } \\\\ , . \\n \\\\label{eq : genrpadressvaldouble}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] here subscript `` val . \\n double \\'\\' indicates that we select a contribution having the same free ends as the r.h.s . \\n of the equation . \\n the numerical factors in front of the individual rpa contributions are derived similarly to the line - dressing factors ( see section  [ sec : particlehole ] ) . \\n explicitly , we deal with a chain of diagrams @xmath119 examining the structure of the above expression we finally arrive at @xmath120 i.e. , we have demonstrated how to dress the valence doubles . \\n this example can be easily generalized to several equivalent vertexes : the eq . \\n has to be rewritten using as the seed object the underlying structure of the unquenched lines produced by a horizontal cross - cut through a diagram . \\n now we specialize our discussion of the rpa - like dressing to the cluster operator truncated at single and double excitations . in this ccsd approximation \\n we obtain for the bare rpa - like insertion @xmath121 notice that one has to be careful when dealing with the first ( singles @xmath122 singles ) term ; it is represented by a disconnected diagram and may produce undesirable disconnected diagrams for matrix elements , eq .  . \\n by substituting the ccsd insertion , eq . \\n , into eq . \\n , we immediately derive expressions for the dressed matrix elements and the rpa - dressed valence doubles . \\n for example , @xmath123 here we omitted a small contribution to @xmath124 , eq . \\n , from the product of core singles . as discussed in section  [ sec : iv ] this contribution would arise in the higher orders ( sixth order ) of mbpt . \\n practically , we notice that among the dominant lccsd diagrams shown in fig .  [ \\n fig : zsdrepresentative ] , the particle - hole vertex occurs only in the rpa diagram @xmath125 . \\n focusing on this particular diagram , the `` upgraded \\'\\' @xmath125 is simply @xmath126 notice that the use of the rpa - dressed matrix elements to upgrade the @xmath125 diagram , such as @xmath127 does not lead to the identical result , because it misses dressing of the @xmath128 vertex . \\n moreover , we found numerically that dressing of both vertexes , as in more general eq .  , is equally important . \\n finally , it is worth noting that with the rpa - like dressing scheme proposed here , the ccsd calculations would recover the entire chain of rpa diagrams . \\n however , if the calculations of the wavefunctions are done using the linearized version of the coupled - cluster equations ( as in refs . \\n @xcite ) , a part of the rpa diagrams would still be missing  @xcite . to summarize , \\n the inclusion of the ccsd non - linear terms in the cc equations is crucial for a fully consistent treatment of the rpa sequence . \\n coupled cluster method can be straightforwardly connected with the direct order - by - order many - body perturbation theory . in particular , for univalent systems , when the calculations are carried out starting from the frozen - core hartree - fock potential , the lowest - order contributions to the double excitation cluster amplitudes are @xmath129 here @xmath130 is the matrix element of the residual ( beyond the hf potential ) coulomb interaction between the electrons . \\n it can be shown that while the lccsd method recovers all third - order diagrams for matrix elements , it starts missing diagrams in the fourth order of mbpt . \\n our group has investigated these 1,648 complementary ivth order diagrams in refs . \\n @xcite . among the diagrams complementary to lccsd matrix element contributions \\n , there are seven terms ( class @xmath131 in ref . \\n @xcite ) due to non - linear terms in the expansion of the ccsd wavefunctions . \\n namely these @xmath131 diagrams provide the lowest - order approximation for the dressing scheme proposed here .    in fig . \\n [ fig : vsivthorder ] we explore the topological structure of the @xmath131 diagrams . \\n all these diagrams come from various ways of lowest - order dressing of @xmath132 diagram , eq .  . \\n a comparison shows that the present dressing approach recovers five ( three line - dressed and two rpa - dressed ) out of seven ivth - order diagrams . \\n the missing diagrams are shown in the bottom row of fig . \\n [ fig : vsivthorder ] , and we call them `` stretched \\'\\' and `` ladder \\'\\' diagrams , the names being derived from the structure of the highlighted dressing insertions . while the ladder diagram comes from the untreated two - body contribution to @xmath0 object , eq .  , the stretched diagram involves more complex _ three_-body contribution to @xmath0 . \\n dressing with these two insertions can be carried out in a way similar to the line- and rpa - like dressing schemes discussed in this paper and is beyond the scope of the present analysis . \\n derived in ref . \\n @xcite . in these diagrams \\n horizonal lines denote coulomb interaction and the topological objects coming from the lowest - order approximation to @xmath0 are highlighted . \\n the upper three diagrams arise in the leading order of the line - dressing scheme and two diagrams in the middle are related to the rpa - dressing scheme . \\n [ fig : vsivthorder ] ]    we verified that in the lowest - order mbpt approximation , eq .  , our dressing formulae reproduce the pertinent ivth - order expressions , explicitly presented in ref .  @xcite . \\n furthermore , in table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] we list numerical values for individual contributions to magnetic - dipole hyperfine structure constant ( hfs ) @xmath133 for ground state of @xmath134cs and e1 transition amplitude for the principal @xmath135 transition in cs . analyzing this table we conclude that both line and rpa  like dressing are equally important . \\n moreover , for these two particular matrix elements there is a partial cancelation between the line and rpa dressed diagrams , so that were one of the dressings omitted , the result would be misleading . \\n we also observe that the untreated `` ladder \\'\\' diagram contributes a negligibly small fraction of the total . at the same time \\n the size of the untreated `` stretched \\'\\' diagram indicates that ( at least for the hfs constant ) it is as important as the rpa -

cluster calculation described in ref .  @xcite \\n . these are linearized coupled - cluster calculations , with the wavefunctions truncated at single and double excitations from the reference slater determinant . \\n in addition , following ref . \\n @xcite , the perturbative effect of triple excitations has been incorporated into the singles - doubles equation ( lccsdpt method ) . \\n the main consequence of this perturbative treatment is that the resulting valence removal energies are complete through the third order of perturbation energies . \\n there is also a substantial ( a few per cent for cs ) improvement in the accuracy of the resulting lccsdpt hyperfine constants over the lccsd values . at the same time \\n the theory - experiment agreement for the e1 amplitudes significantly degrades ( see table  [ tab : dsummary ] ) : while the lccsd amplitudes differ by 0.4% from 0.03%-accurate experimental data  @xcite , the more sophisticated lccsdpt matrix elements deviate from measurements by as much as 1.3% . in other words , \\n both lccsd and lccsdpt methods are poorly suited for calculating parity - non - conserving ( pnc ) amplitudes in @xmath134cs with uncertainty of a few 0.1% . \\n it is one of the goals of this paper to establish a method that would provide a consistent accuracy for both hfs constants and dipole matrix elements ( and thus pnc amplitudes ) . \\n _ procedure . \\n _ first we solved the relativistic lccsdpt equations , as described in ref . \\n @xcite . with the computed cluster amplitudes we calculated lccsdpt matrix elements and recovered results published in ref . \\n further , we solved the line - dressing equations   and computed the line - dressed cluster amplitudes and matrix elements . \\n the convergence rate was fast : four iterations were sufficient to stabilize the norms of the line - dressed cluster amplitudes at a level of a few parts per million . \\n finally , we solved the iterative equation for the rpa - dressed valence amplitudes , eq .. it turned out to be very computationally intensive part of the scheme and we iterated the equations only once . \\n we used the computed rpa - dressed valence amplitudes in calculations of the dominant diagram @xmath113 , see eq .  . \\n in the remaining diagrams that involve particle - hole matrix elements , we employed rpa - dressed matrix elements @xmath146 . a numerical iterative solution of equations for @xmath146 , eq . \\n required only a few iterations to converge to seven significant figures . \\n _ line dressing . \\n _ in table  [ tab : cslinedress ] we illustrate the importance of line dressing ; in this table we present differences between line - dressed and bare lccsdpt diagrams for the the hyperfine constant and e1 amplitude . \\n the dressing of the leading order hf diagram subsumes the lccsd diagrams @xmath147 and @xmath148 , eq .  . a direct calculation of these diagrams results in @xmath149 mhz for @xmath3 and @xmath150 a.u \\n . for the e1 amplitude . \\n these values are consistent with dressing - induced modifications of the hf diagram ( @xmath151 mhz and @xmath152 a.u . , respectively ) from table  [ tab : cslinedress ] . \\n the modifications of the @xmath132 diagram are consistent with the values of the pertinent fourth - order diagrams , see section  [ sec : iv ] and table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] . a large dressing correction for hfs \\n constant comes from the diagram @xmath153 ; it is nominally a fifth - order diagram . \\n the relative importance of this diagram is not surprising since it is based upon brueckner orbitals ( self - energy or core polarization effect ) . as for the e1 amplitude , \\n the line - dressing correction is dominated by @xmath132 ; i.e. , it is dominated by the fourth - order contribution . for the hfs constant \\n , a relative smallness of the line - dressing correction to @xmath132 diagram arises due to a delicate cancelation of relatively large contributions from dressing of the core , particle and valence lines of the diagram ( see table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] ) . \\n finally , in the bottom line of the table  [ tab : cslinedress ] we present a difference between the line - dressed ( all diagrams ) and bare values . \\n the dressing of the hf diagram plays a negligible role here , since it is dominated by the diagrams already included in the lccsdpt values . \\n the line dressing contributes at a sizable 0.5% level to the hfs constant and at 0.2% level to the e1 amplitude . \\n ldd type & & + @xmath154 & -22 & -1.7[-3 ] + @xmath132 & 0.04 & 9.3[-3 ] + @xmath153 & -8.6 & -0.5[-3 ] + @xmath155 & -0.8 & -3.6[-5 ] + all diagrams & -11 & 8.0[-3 ] +    _ rpa -

hole matrix elements ( @xmath156 ) in diagrams beyond @xmath132 played a relatively minor role , contributing at a level of only 0.01% for both test cases .    _ complementary fourth - order diagrams . _ \\n the lccsdpt method misses certain many -

order triples in tables  [ tab : hfssummary ] and  [ tab : dsummary ] . \\n diagrams @xmath169 are contributions of disconnected quadruples . as discussed in section  [ sec : iv ] namely one of such contributions , @xmath170 , provides the lowest - order approximation to our all - order dressing scheme . in tables \\n [ tab : hfssummary ] and  [ tab : dsummary ] we added the contributions of untreated `` stretched \\'\\' and `` ladder \\'\\' diagrams of the @xmath170 class and also from @xmath171 class . the latter contribution would have been accounted for by solving the full ( not linearized ) cc equations . in our large - scale fourth - order calculations \\n we have employed the code described in ref . \\n @xcite ; all the formulas for a large number of diagrams and the code have been generated automatically using symbolic algebra tools . \\n while the resulting fourth - order corrections from triples are at the level of 1% , we notice that there are certain noticeable cancelations between various diagrams . \\n thus a complete all - order treatment of triples would be essential for attaining the next level of theoretical accuracy . \\n _ hyperfine constant results . \\n _ details of calculation of the hyperfine constant @xmath172 are presented in table  [ tab : hfssummary ] . to clarify the role of correlations , \\n we first incorporate a number of small but important effects into the reference value : bohr - weiskopf effect , breit and radiative corrections . \\n the `` lccsdpt , coulomb \\'\\' value has been computed using the finite nuclear size , both for determination of wavefunctions and computing matrix elements of hyperfine interaction ( this accounts for 0.5% . ) \\n we also include breit corrections from ref . \\n @xcite ; these corrections differ substantially from those incorporated in ref . \\n @xcite due to order - of - magnitude important correlation corrections . finally , radiative corrections to magnetic - dipole hyperfine - structure constants for the ground state of alkali - metal atoms were computed recently by @xcite . \\n they found that the vacuum polarization and self - energy ( vp+se ) contribute as much as 0.4% to the _ ab initio _ value . \\n the reader should be careful with adopting breit values from ref.@xcite , because these values do not include correlation corrections ( see ref . \\n @xcite and references therein ) . \\n the final value , marked as `` lccsdpt reference \\'\\' deviates by 0.9% from ( exact ) experimental value .    dressing corrections partially cancel , resulting in 0.3% total dressing contribution . \\n fourth - order diagrams , complementary to those already included in the lccsdpt value are dominated by a contribution due to triple excitations ( 0.8% ) . \\n we also include the `` stretched \\'\\' and  ladder \" iv - order diagrams missed by our dressing scheme ( see section  [ sec : iv ] ) . \\n almost all the correlation corrections are of similar sizes but of different signs , so the dressing and iv - th order corrections cancel , so that the final correlation correction is only 0.1% , just slightly improving the theory - experiment agreement when compared with the `` lccsdpt reference \\'\\' value . our _ ab initio _ \\n value for the hfs constant deviates by 0.8% from the experimental value .    _ \\n electric - dipole @xmath4 transition amplitude . _ \\n details of calculation for the dipole matrix element are compiled in table  [ tab : dsummary ] . \\n we do not include breit and radiative corrections in that table , since the breit interaction contributes only 0.02% to this matrix element  @xcite , and radiative corrections are not known from the literature . \\n there were several high - accuracy experimental determinations of @xmath173 matrix element . \\n we list these matrix elements in the bottom of table  [ tab : dsummary ] . in refs . \\n @xcite this matrix element has been extracted from the measured lifetime of the @xmath174 state . \\n determination of ref . \\n @xcite is based on photoassociative spectroscopy of cold cs atoms ( i.e. , inferred from high - accuracy measurement of molecular potentials ) . \\n another approach to extraction of dipole matrix elements has been proposed by us in ref . \\n @xcite : we exploited an enhanced sensitivity of static electric - dipole polarizability @xmath175 of the ground state and van der waals coefficient @xmath176 of the ground molecular state to the matrix elements of principal transitions @xmath177 and @xmath173 . \\n essential to the extraction of individual matrix elements was a high - accuracy ratio of these two dipole matrix elements measured in ref . \\n @xcite . based on the proposed method  @xcite \\n , the @xmath173 matrix element has been deduced from high - accuracy @xmath176 in ref . \\n @xcite and in ref . \\n @xcite it has been inferred from @xmath175 measured in that work . \\n the most accurate matrix element comes from photoassociation spectroscopy  @xcite ; their result has 0.03% accuracy and we will use that value below for calibrating _ ab initio _ calculations . \\n the reference lccsdpt e1 matrix element deviates from high - accuracy measurements by as much as 1.3% . \\n the correlation corrections ( dressing and fourth - order ) computed by us improve the agreement to about 0.6% , i.e. , the _ ab initio _ accuracy becomes comparable to that for the hfs constant . \\n an analysis of table  [ tab : dsummary ] shows that due to cancelation of line- and rpa - like - dressing corrections the overall effect of dressing is negligible for this transition amplitude . at the same time , the forth - order corrections due to triple excitations beyond lccsdpt triples are very large , almost 1% . \\n there corrections due to residual fourth - order rpa corrections ( @xmath178 ) are also sizable , and tend to decrease the effect of triples . \\n our forth - order calculation demonstrates that a full ( beyond that of lccsdpt ) treatment of triple excitations improves the accuracy of _ ab initio _ transition amplitudes . \\n the main two results of this work are : ( i ) development and application of all - order dressing formalism for matrix elements computed with coupled - cluster method ; ( ii ) first calculations of matrix elements for cs complete through the fourth order of many - body perturbation theory .    to reiterate , \\n our dressing formalism is built upon a hierarchical expansion of the product of clusters @xmath0 into a sum of @xmath2-body insertions . \\n we considered two types of insertions : particle / hole line insertion coming from the one - body part of the product and two - particle / two - hole rpa - like insertion due to the two - body part . \\n we demonstrated how to `` dress \\'\\' these insertions and formulated iterative equations . \\n particular attention has been paid to the singles - doubles truncation of the full cluster operator and we derived the dressing equations for this popular approximation . \\n we have upgraded coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements with the dressed insertions for univalent systems and highlighted a relation to pertinent fourth - order diagrams . \\n finally , we illustrated our formalism with relativistic calculations for cs atom . \\n our relativistic calculations also include a large number of fourth - order diagrams complementary to lccsdpt method ( linearized coupled - cluster single - doubles method with perturbative treatment of triples ; it is the most sophisticated cc approximation applied in relativistic calculations for cs so far ) . \\n the resulting analysis is complete through the fourth - order of many - body perturbation theory . \\n we find that these complementary diagrams substantially improve the theory - experiment agreement for an important electric - dipole @xmath4 transition amplitude , and slightly better the agreement for the hyperfine constant . \\n we found sizable cancelations between various fourth - order contributions ; a full all - order treatment of triple and disconnected quadruple excitations is desirable to further improve the theoretical accuracy .', \"we consider evaluation of matrix elements with the coupled - cluster method . \\n such calculations formally involve infinite number of terms and we devise a method of partial summation ( dressing ) of the resulting series . \\n our formalism is built upon an expansion of the product @xmath0 of cluster amplitudes @xmath1 into a sum of @xmath2-body insertions . \\n we consider two types of insertions : particle / hole line insertion and two -

variational approximation . \\n a detailed account of this technique in the context of solitons can be found , for instance , in ref . \\n @xcite . in this approach \\n we first identify the energy @xmath7 of our system : @xmath8 next we introduce the variational ansatz for the modulus of @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the width of the soliton and @xmath12 is the asymmetry parameter defined

ansatz ] ) \\n the energy can be expressed in terms of variational parameters upon performing integration over @xmath16 : @xmath17 notice that @xmath7 now depends on the norm @xmath0 and variational parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 . with increasing value of @xmath12 , the interaction energy @xmath18 decreases , while the tunneling energy @xmath19 increases . \\n moreover , the interaction energy scales like @xmath20 , while the tunneling energy scales like @xmath0 . \\n hence , for small values of @xmath0 stable states will be symmetric ( @xmath14 ) , while for @xmath0 above a certain critical value they become asymmetric . \\n this is summarized in fig.([fig2 ] ) . \\n stationary solutions can be found considering @xmath21 , which leads to our friend @xmath15 as in the exact

we expect that , when the total norm exceeds the critical value discussed above ( @xmath30 ) the system becomes unstable during the collision , especially when the overlap of the wavefunctions is substantial . \\n the main subject of the present section is the study of instability in the bogolibov manner . for this purpose \\n we add small initial asymmetric perturbations to both dcs . \\n these perturbations will be amplified during the collision due to the instability . \\n we analyze the growth of the instability by monitoring the asymmetry parameter in time @xmath31    an example of the collisional event is illustrated in fig.([figur ] ) . \\n here we plot the asymmetry parameter versus time . at the initial time , \\n when two dcs s are far apart we add a small asymmetric perturbation . \\n this perturbation causes the asymmetry parameter to oscillate . \\n asymptotically , before and after the collision , oscillations are harmonic , with constant amplitude . \\n interaction during the collision can amplify the perturbation , as seen in the figure ( [ figur ] ) . in the regime of small perturbations the final amplitude of the oscillation \\n is directly proportional to the initial amplitude of oscillation ( the bogoliubov approximation is valid ) . \\n hence we choose the ratio of the final amplitude to the initial one as a measure of instability and

comparison with bogoliubov analysis ( the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) we linearize the above equations @xmath75 and combine them to obtain an equation for @xmath62 @xmath76 to understand equation ( [ insta1 ] ) we use the analogy of a classical ball on a spring . if we denote the position of the ball by @xmath12 and its velocity by @xmath66 , the last term in equation ( [ insta1 ] ) represent a harmonic force with time dependent spring constant @xmath77 , see fig . \\n ( [ figur ] ) . \\n the function @xmath78 depends on the overlap of the colliding solitons . long before and long after the collision , \\n when solitons are practically independent , the coefficient @xmath78 is constant and equal to @xmath79 . \\n therefore asymptotically the spring constant is equal to @xmath80 . \\n if we refer to previous considerations in section [ sec2 ] we recognize that it can be rewritten as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the critical norm given by the variational approximation . \\n for that reason the spring constant is asymptotically positive when the single dcs is stable and @xmath62 performs harmonic oscillations before and after the collision , as seen in figure ( [ figur ] ) . \\n the dynamics of the collision can be interpreted in terms of the ball on spring analogy . during the collision the value of the spring \\n constant can be negative . \\n then the harmonic force acting on our ball changes its character from attractive to repulsive . \\n it can add energy to the system increasing the amplitude of oscillations , which is the case shown in fig . \\n ( [ figur ] ) . \\n but it can conversely decrease the amplitude when the ball is moving towards the center . as we see \\n the amplification depends crucially on the initial velocity @xmath83 . in conclusion \\n the

calculations . \\n additionally we need to rescale the function @xmath78 since the value of the critical norm @xmath90 is slightly larger that the variational estimate @xmath27 . in our case \\n the rescaling factor is @xmath91 . \\n the results of our studies are summarized in figures ( [ fig30 ] ) and ( [ fig40 ] ) . to obtain the first figure we fixed the values of @xmath0 and @xmath49 . \\n next for each value of relative phase @xmath45 we found the range of amplification @xmath32 corresponding to the full range of @xmath57 . \\n we chose the minimal and maximal values of @xmath32 and marked them on the figure . \\n we show the results for two particular cases . \\n first we took a soliton norm to be slightly above the threshold @xmath92 , and observed small amplification . \\n then we increased the norm and decreased the velocity to obtain much larger amplification . in both cases we observed qualitative agreement between numerical results and the variational approximation . \\n we also notice that the range of amplification , corresponding to different values of @xmath57 is very wide . \\n the main result is presented in fig . \\n ( [ fig40 ] ) . in this study \\n we fix the velocity of the solitons and vary their norm . for each value of the norm we find the minimum and maximum of the amplification with respect to different values of both @xmath45 and @xmath57 . \\n we see that the maximal amplification becomes significant when the norm exceeds @xmath92 .     versus total norm @xmath0 . \\n the points follow from the bogolubov method as described in the text

\\n fortunately , results are similar and the interactions are well described by both models . \\n the main physical effect so described is the enhancement ( or suppression ) of the amplitude of small oscillations on two colliding pairs of solitons in the double channel case . \\n this phenomenon turned out to be extremely sensitive to the relative phase of the colliding partners . \\n m.t . was

response - theory ( lrt ) in the lda with the abinit package . \\n consistent with the common overestimation of bond strengths in the lda we obtain here a somewhat larger zero - pressure phonon frequency , such that the two theoretical values bracket the experimental data at zero pressure . over the whole pressure \\n range the lda / lrt calculation gives phonon frequencies which are consistently @xmath22.4% larger than the corresponding gga / fp results . \\n consequently , we obtain essentially the same pressure dependence @xmath15 for the two calculations . the deviation of the calculations from the experimental data is far beyond the typical uncertainty of such computations \\n the important difference between theory and experiment could be that the former is based on the ideal stoichiometry al@xmath16b@xmath0 whereas the real sample is al deficient .    for comparison with previous calculations for mgb@xmath0 \\n we have also calculated the frequency @xmath17 of the @xmath18 phonon in alb@xmath0  ( out -

independent @xmath20 the relation @xmath21 holds . \\n thus , for both the @xmath1 and the @xmath18 mode in alb@xmath0  with @xmath22 there is a nearly inverse - proportional relation between the phonon frequency and volume . \\n this is quite different from the situation in mgb@xmath0  where we do not only have the very large @xmath23 for the @xmath1 mode as noted before but also a rather small @xmath24 for the @xmath18 phonon ( table  [ tab : phonons ] ) . \\n the frozen phonon calculations also yield information on the anharmonicity of the phonon modes as described in the context of our mgb@xmath0  calculations @xcite . \\n in essence , the variation of the total energy with atomic displacement , @xmath25 , can be represented by a polynomial where the ratio of the quartic to squared quadratic coefficients @xmath26 is a measure of anharmonicity . in the harmonic limit @xmath27 . for the @xmath1 mode in alb@xmath0 \\n we obtain @xmath28  ev@xmath29 which is about three orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding values for mgb@xmath0  of @xmath308  ev@xmath29 ( see refs .  ) . \\n small anharmonicities are calculated for the @xmath18 modes of both compounds : @xmath31 for alb@xmath0  and @xmath32 for mgb@xmath0 . \\n in our x - ray diffraction and raman experiments we do not find any indication for a structural phase transition or modulation of the structure . \\n group - subgroup symmetry considerations @xcite indicate numerous possible distortions of the aristotype alb@xmath0  most of which are realized in intermetallic compounds at ambient pressure . \\n pressure - induced structural phase transitions of xy@xmath33 intermetallic compounds have not been studied systematically . in the context of the alb@xmath0  structure a number of rare - earth metal digallides @xcite , khg@xmath0 @xcite , and lacu@xmath0 \\n @xcite were investigated at high pressures . from the available data a transition between the structure types alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 appears as a typical route . \\n the khg@xmath0 ( cecu@xmath0 ) structure type may occur as an intermediate phase . \\n alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 are isopointal structures , distinguished only by their @xmath4 ratios . \\n two clearly separated groups of compounds of alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 type are observed when plotting the @xmath4 ratio versus ratio of the metallic radii of xy@xmath0 intermetallic compounds @xcite . \\n the alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 type branches are characterized by @xmath4 ratios of 0.951.20 and 0.600.85 , respectively . \\n the compound alb@xmath0  with @xmath34 ( at 0  gpa ) is located near the center of the former branch . in the pressure range to 40  gpa explored here \\n it decreases only to 1.060 . \\n pressures well above 1  mbar may therefore be needed for a possible transition towards the uhg@xmath0 structure . at lower pressures \\n a transition involving a buckling of the boron honeycomb layers may occur which could lead to phases of the cecu@xmath0 , cecd@xmath0 , or cain@xmath0 type @xcite . \\n raman spectroscopy is commonly applied to semiconductors and insulators but only to a much smaller extend to metals . \\n it is essentially the group of elemental hcp metals that has been studied systematically , already in the late 1960s at ambient pressure @xcite and more recently at high pressures ( see e.g.  refs .   and references therein ) . \\n it may therefore be attributed to a lack of reference data that in case of mgb@xmath0  the observation of a very broad raman feature ( fwhm of @xmath2300  ) near 600  lead to a still unresolved controversy over the origin of this peak . \\n it has initially been attributed @xcite to the raman - active @xmath1 mode which immediately raises the question of the large linewidth . \\n the large peak width has been related to both strong electron phonon coupling and to structural disorder . \\n the latter now appears less likely because raman spectra of mgb@xmath0  powders are quite similar to those of recently available small single crystals @xcite which are presumably less disordered . \\n high - pressure raman experiments @xcite have cast doubt on the assignment to the @xmath1 phonon . they revealed a double - peak structure with peaks at 603(6 )  and 750(20 )  . \\n neither of the two peaks could be attributed to the @xmath1 mode because of severe deviations from calculated phonon frequencies in terms of zero - pressure frequencies and/or the pressure dependences . \\n the present raman data of alb@xmath0  show that it is possible to obtain raman spectra with a well - defined @xmath1 peak from metallic samples of the alb@xmath0  structure . \\n the difficulties encountered in case of mgb@xmath0  are therefore not likely related to the metallicity of the sample nor intrinsic to the structure type . \\n crystallinity also appears to have only a small effect on the raman spectrum as the raman linewidth of the alb@xmath0  powder sample is comparable to that of the alb@xmath0  crystallites . \\n there are two properties of mgb@xmath0  with regard to phonons which make it distinct from alb@xmath0 . \\n first , the whole @xmath1 phonon branch along the @xmath35@xmath36 direction in the brillouin zone exhibits very strong electron - phonon coupling in mgb@xmath0  @xcite . \\n second , the @xmath37 mode shows pronounced anharmonicity @xcite . \\n both electron - phonon and phonon - phonon interaction decrease the phonon lifetime and hence increase the phonon linewidth @xcite . \\n they are therefore the most likely causes for the absence of a well - defined @xmath1 raman peak in mgb@xmath0 . \\n our x - ray diffraction data indicate an al deficiency of 11% in alb@xmath0  in accord with previous density measurements and chemical analysis @xcite as well as recent single - crystal x - ray diffraction results @xcite . \\n although the change of the @xmath1 phonon frequency at different sample spots suggests that there is some variation of the al content , there is no indication that growth of aluminum diboride in the composition al@xmath38b@xmath0 is possible . \\n the occurrence of substantial metal deficiency appears to be common to many ( transition ) metal diborides @xcite .    at ambient pressure . \\n energies are given with respect to the fermi energy @xmath39 . \\n the dos is given in units of ( states / ev / formula unit ) . ]    in case of alb@xmath0  this metal deficiency has important influence on the electronic structure . \\n a comparison of the calculated bandstructures of alb@xmath0  and mgb@xmath0  shows that the relative ordering and dispersions of the bands near the fermi level are very similar . \\n the difference between alb@xmath0and mgb@xmath0  can largely be treated in a rigid - band picture with a higher band filling for alb@xmath0 . \\n it is therefore justified to discuss the observed al deficiency of @xmath210% in a rigid - band picture , too . \\n figure  [ fig : bs - dos ] shows the calculated electronic bandstructure @xcite and density of states of alb@xmath0 . in case of the stoichiometric compound \\n the @xmath40-type bands derived from boron @xmath41 states and the bands with al-@xmath42 character ( near @xmath35 ) are partially filled and give rise to the metallic state . \\n 10% deficiency of al removes 0.3 valence electrons and consequently lowers @xmath39 by 0.9  ev which leads to a _ \\n complete depletion of the band with character_. in other words , the experimentally observed al deficiency is expected to lead to a qualitative change in the electronic structure compared to the ideal case of al@xmath16b@xmath0 . in terms of the fermi surface \\n this change means a removal of the electron pocket around @xmath35 . \\n the measured mode - grneisen parameter of the al@xmath43b@xmath0 sample is @xmath220% larger than calculated for al@xmath38b@xmath0 , a deviation which is far beyond the typical uncertainty of such computations . \\n the zero - pressure phonon frequency , on the other hand , seems to be hardly affected . \\n the apparent difference between experiment and calculation is the al deficiency of the sample which was not taken into account in the theory . \\n we tentatively attribute the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated mode - grneisen parameters to the al - deficiency - induced electronic changes discussed above . \\n however , it can not be excluded at this point that other effects are also at work . \\n a more detailed analysis of the effect of al deficiency on the electronic and lattice dynamical properties of alb@xmath0  is , however , beyond the scope of this work . \\n mg deficiency in mgb@xmath0  was often indicated by the occurrence of mgo as a secondary phase in mgb@xmath0  samples that were grown from a molar 1:2 mixture of mg and b. variations of @xmath3  and even more of the pressure dependence of @xmath3  for different samples appeared to be related to non - stoichiometry of the material . \\n the correlation between composition , structural parameters and @xmath3  has been established in an experiment by indenbom _ \\n et al . _ \\n @xcite . by diffusion of mg into a boron cylinder they produced a sample with a composition changing gradually between mg@xmath38b@xmath0 and mg@xmath44b@xmath0 . with decreasing mg \\n content the lattice parameter @xmath8 increased by 0.003   ( 0.1% ) and @xmath3  increased from 37.2 to 39.0  k.    tissen _ et al . _ \\n @xcite furthermore pointed out a correlation between the zero - pressure critical temperature @xmath45 and the pressure derivative @xmath46 : as @xmath45 increases from 37.3 to 39.2  k for various samples , @xmath46 changes from @xmath47 to @xmath48  k / gpa . \\n et al . _ \\n @xcite discussed a similar observation on a smaller number of samples in terms of the electronic band structure and band - filling effects related to the mg non - stoichiometry . on the other hand , \\n the pressure - induced changes of the electronic density of states calculated for mgb@xmath0  are too small to account for the observed decrease of @xmath3  under compression @xcite . \\n it is rather the increase in the relevant phonon frequencies which provides the main contribution to the pressure dependence of @xmath3  @xcite \\n . it would therefore be rather surprising if electronic density effects \\n i.e. , the electronic density @xmath49 at the fermi level  were responsible for the large sensitivity of @xmath46 on mg non - stoichiometry . \\n the indications that al deficiency in alb@xmath0  may affect the pressure dependence of the @xmath1 phonon frequency hints at an alternative possible explanation for the large sensitivity of @xmath46 on mg deficiency in mgb@xmath0 . \\n it was first pointed out by yilderim _ \\n et al._@xcite that the @xmath1 phonon mode in mgb@xmath0  exhibits a very large anharmonicity . \\n et al . _ \\n @xcite showed theoretically that this effect arises in mgb@xmath0  because here the fermi level @xmath39 is located only @xmath20.5  ev below the top of @xmath50 bands of the equilibrium structure . \\n the lattice distortion of the @xmath1 mode induces a splitting of these @xmath50 bands large enough that the lower split - off band sinks completely below @xmath39 @xcite . \\n this does not happen in alb@xmath0and graphite , and anharmonicity is indeed negligible . \\n it is also noteworthy that the @xmath1 mode in alb@xmath0  is much higher in energy than the @xmath18 phonon whereas the reversed order is calculated for mgb@xmath0  ( see table  [ tab : phonons ] ) although both compounds are structurally quite similar . \\n this effect was pointed out before and studied in mg@xmath51al@xmath52b@xmath0 mixed crystals by renker _ \\n et al . _ \\n the interchange , which occurs only in undoped or moderately substituted material ( @xmath53 ) , was also attributed to the electronic changes , especially the disappearance of the hole pockets from the fermi surface for @xmath54 . \\n the metal content in mgb@xmath0  affects the band filling , a larger mg deficiency moving the fermi level further below the top of the @xmath50  bands . \\n it is therefore to be expected that the anharmonicity of the @xmath1 mode should decrease with decreasing mg content . \\n lattice dynamical calculations showed that the @xmath1 anharmonicity decreases with increasing pressure @xcite and the initially very large mode - grneisen parameter decreases too @xcite . \\n if the mode - grneisen parameters decreases as function of band filling at ambient pressure , i.e. , due to non - stoichiometry of mgb@xmath0 , it would , qualitatively , lead to the observed relation between @xmath46 and mg deficiency . \\n this effect would be a manifestation of the changes of the lattice dynamics rather than changes of the electronic density of states . \\n a more detailed and quantitative analysis is certainly needed , but the present results are indication of the importance of stoichiometry with regard to the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 , specifically the pressure dependence of @xmath3 . \\n we have studied the crystal structure of alb@xmath0  by x -

center phonon in metallic alb@xmath0  can be observed as a well - defined raman peak . \\n we conclude that the lack of such a raman feature in mgb@xmath0  is neither related to the metallicity or disorder of the sample nor is it a generic property of alb@xmath0-type compounds . \\n our observations rather support the view that it is due to the strong electron - phonon coupling and/or anharmonicity which are distinct properties of mgb@xmath0 . \\n we found some deviation of the calculated pressure dependence of the @xmath1 phonon frequency of alb@xmath0  from the experimental data and tentatively attributed this to the al deficiency of the alb@xmath0  sample which was not taken into account in the theory . \\n correlations between non - stoichiometry of mgb@xmath0  and its superconducting properties have been pointed out previously . here \\n we considered possible effects of mg deficiency in mgb@xmath0  on its electronic structure and lattice dynamics . \\n the anticipated changes are consistent with the available experimental data on the correlation between mg content and the pressure dependence of @xmath3 . \\n this leads us to propose that the large variation of the pressure dependence of @xmath3  ( @xmath55 to @xmath47 k / gpa ) in mgb@xmath0  in various experiments may be caused by the effect of non -

the intercepts of these lines form a rotation orbit on the interval @xmath6 $ ] . \\n so by property [ prop_rotation ] they induce a partition of this interval in subintervals of _ at most _ three

partition of @xmath11 $ ] in subintervals having lengths in the same set @xmath12 . \\n it now follows that vertical distances between adjacent parallel lines are in the set @xmath12 . \\n we will distinguish between three types of polygons : those that have no side which is part of the boundary of @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] ( type @xmath13 ) , those that have exactly one such a side ( type @xmath14 ) and those that have two or more ( type @xmath15 ) . \\n + the polygons of type @xmath13 must be parallelograms . \\n the area of such a parallelogram is given by @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , and

parallelogram shapes is again six , since reflections do not count . \\n the triangles that are half of a rhombus can have at most six different shapes , since there are three types of rhombi which can be cut either horizontally or vertically . \\n the rest of the argument does nt change , so there are at most three more different shapes than different areas , which establishes the upper bound of at most sixteen different shapes . \\n + the sharpness of these bounds follows from example [ ex_13flakes ] in section [ example ] . \\n @xmath21    [ remark]as the careful reader may have noted , the construction of the billiard orbit always gives a truncation on the left boundary or on the lower boundary of the square . \\n so strictly speaking , theorem [ theorem_13areas ] is not proved in

reached for all @xmath34 . \\n since this interval contains rationals , we see that rationality is not sufficient for a sharper upper bound . \\n + since the orbit is periodic , the partition does nt change anymore if @xmath32 is large enough . \\n taking @xmath35 shows that @xmath13 is a sharp lower bound for the limiting number of shapes . \\n for the upper bound , suppose that @xmath22 . \\n by

touches all sides of the square before becoming periodic . these triangles are quarters of the rhombus , thus having area @xmath42 . \\n this makes at most three different areas in total . to see that this upper bound is sharp , \\n see figure [ pic_rational].@xmath21    surprisingly , there exist irrational @xmath1 for which the upper bound of thirteen different areas is never reached :    let

lengths will disappear and new lengths will be created . in @xcite and @xcite \\n it was shown that the largest length is always the first to disappear . \\n a new length only pops up if there are

\\n recall that the areas of the parallelograms are determined by a product of two lengths in @xmath12 . by the above reasoning , if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 , which implies that the parallelograms

t relation changes with rate . \\n the magnitude of this effect depends on the variation of the drift velocity with e , which is strongly dependent on the gas . + for calculations of the gas gain , only the field near the wire has to be known . in this case \\n , the above formula can be simplified to @xmath29 the electric field in the avalanche region behaves as if the effective voltage at the wire was @xmath30 . \\n + taking now a model for the gas amplification where the gas gain is a function of the applied voltage , one should be able to describe the dependence of the gas gain reduction as a function of the rate . \\n we will use the diethorn formula @xcite @xmath31 } \\\\ \\\\ . \\n \\\\label{eq : gain}\\\\ ] ]    the diethorn model has two parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 which are characteristic for every gas mixture . \\n @xmath34 is the potential difference an electron passes between two successive ionisations and @xmath33 is the critical value of @xmath35 where ionisation starts . \\n @xmath36 is the ratio of the actual pressure @xmath37 to the reference pressure @xmath38 where k was determined . \\n + for calculating the actual gas gain at rate @xmath18 , one now has to replace @xmath5 by @xmath39 in ( [ eq : gain ] ) where @xmath40 is given by ( [ eq : dv ] ) . \\n @xmath40 depends on the gain and vice versa . \\n the two equations have been solved in an iterative way to get a self consistent gain for every rate . \\n + one more correction has to be made for high rates : it was ignored in ( [ eq : t+ ] ) that the ion drift time @xmath10 depends on the rate . for a better approximation of @xmath10 in ( [ eq : dv ] ) , one can insert into ( [ eq : mue ] ) the electric field ( [ eq : newfield ] ) which leads to the formula @xmath41 }   \\\\label{eq : newt+ } \\\\   .\\\\ ] ] in the limit of rate @xmath42 , this is identical to ( [ eq : t+ ] ) . \\n the change of @xmath10 with rate is plotted in fig.[fig = iondrift ] for the gas ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4 % . + \\n to measure effects of high rates , a specially designed chamber was built for operation in the m2 muon beam at cern . \\n the task of this setup was to see only effects coming from space charges and to avoid measuring electronic effects such as saturation of preamplifiers , baseline shifts etc . a schematic drawing and a photo \\n are shown in figs . \\n [ fig = schematic ] and [ fig = photo ] , respectively . \\n the chamber consists of 24 drift tubes : two bundles of eight tubes with 3 cm diameter , two tubes with 2 cm and two tubes with 4 cm diameter . \\n the tubes are glued together precisely , and the two bundles are staggered to improve track fitting . + for measuring the second coordinate , four tubes are placed perpendicular to the others . \\n all tubes are 30 cm long , but the active length is only 4 cm in the middle part of the tubes for the precision coordinate and 10 cm for the second coordinate ( fig . [ \\n fig = schematic ] bottom ) . in order to passivate the rest of the tube , \\n the wires have been coated galvanically with silver to increase the wire diameter from 50@xmath1 m to 150@xmath1 m in order to avoid gas amplification . \\n the trigger is made of a coincidence of four scintillation counters which cover an area of 1 cm ( along the wires ) @xmath43 6 cm (= two tubes in height ) and are placed in the middle of the active part of the tubes . \\n + the whole setup can be moved horizontally by a stepper motor within a range of 1 m from the centre of the muon beam . by moving the apparatus with respect to the beam \\n one can adjust the trigger rate from 10hz/@xmath0 up to more than 10khz/@xmath0 . \\n whereas in atlas the tubes will be read out with tdcs , here the full analog pulse information was read out with 250 mhz flash adcs @xcite . \\n this is necessary for measuring pulse height reductions and to be independent of a fixed discriminator threshold . \\n +    an important property of the data acquisition was the ability to record at least 8 successive tracks without dead time . \\n this is necessary for the calculation of time distances between consecutive hits from which the particle rate is calculated . \\n it is also used to observe effects coming from event - to - event fluctuations where the `` history '' of the tube has to be known . \\n thus it can be studied how previous hits influence the properties of the detector for the following hits . \\n + in order to achieve this readout without dead time , a trigger logic has been set up that does not need any readout cycle between the first and eighth event trigger . the memory depth of the flash adc is 2048 bytes per channel corresponding to 8192 ns in time which is large enough to store the waveforms of 8 pulses . \\n the digitization of the flash adcs is started for each new muon trigger and stopped after 1@xmath1s . \\n +    the time differences between consecutive triggers were measured with a setup of slow tdcs ( clock ) covering a time range of @xmath44 20 ms . with this information it is possible to compute for every tube the time differences to the last hit . \\n the distribution of these times is exponential ( fig . \\n [ fig = zeitvert ] ) . \\n the mean value is @xmath45 , in agreement with the number of triggers per second counted with a scaler . with this measurements \\n we know both , the time difference between two consecutive hits and ( from the second coordinate measurements ) the spatial distance of the muon tracks along the wire . + \\n a typical size for the data that had to be read out after every cycle ( 8 events ) was 40 kb . \\n the data were processed by a vme processor operated under os9 and stored on an exabyte tape . to maximize the readout speed , all time critical routines \\n have been written in assembler code . \\n the maximum readout rate that could be achieved ( if the particle rate was high enough ) was @xmath46 events within one spill of the cern sps accelerator ( 2.4s beam followed by a pause of ) and was limited by the speed of the tape drive . \\n the time needed to take a high statistics run ( 800.000 triggers ) at highest rates was 4 hours . \\n + a slow control system was installed to monitor the relevant parameters such as temperature , gas flow , gas mixture , pressure and the high voltages of the tubes . \\n + the measurement of drift times with this kind of flash adc needs a special setup . \\n the time difference between incoming start signal and start of the digitization can vary randomly between 0 and 12ns . in order to get a precise time marker , \\n the trigger signal starting the readout was delayed by 800 ns and fed into the test input of the preamplifiers fbpanik-04 @xcite . \\n thus , every drift chamber pulse was followed by a reference pulse coming always with the same delay with respect to the muon trigger . \\n the time difference between the pulse and the reference pulse is the drift time plus a constant offset t@xmath47 . \\n + the time bins of the flash adcs have a width of 4 ns . to get a better time resolution of the pulse , the dos ( difference of samples ) method was used which was developed for the analysis of the flash adc data of the opal experiment@xcite . \\n this method is numerically rather simple but very efficient in both finding pulses and calculating the drift time with an accuracy better than 1ns . \\n first , the pulse shape is differentiated by subtracting the pulse heights of successive bins . \\n then pulses can be found if the differentiated pulse reaches a certain threshold . \\n finally the drift time is calculated as the weighted mean of the differentiated pulse around the position of the maximum of the differentiated pulse . + an event display of a muon passing the chamber is shown in fig . \\n [ fig = eventdisplay ] . + \\n in order to measure the correct gain drop that is only due to particle rate one has to take care of several effects that influence the measured pulse height . \\n first of all , only data from the same tube are compared to exclude systematic errors like dependence on preamplifiers or slightly different gas mixtures . \\n + one important quantity is the temperature of the gas . \\n the pulse height increases with temperature if the pressure is kept constant ( fig.[fig = gainmeas ] ) . \\n the order of magnitude of this effect is some percent per kelvin . \\n since the data were taken in a non - air - conditioned hall with temperature variations of up to 5k within one measurement , temperature corrections of the pulse height had to be done . \\n gas gain measurements at different temperatures have been done with the setup described in @xcite for the gases that were tested in beam measurements . \\n thus it was possible to apply the correct temperature corrections and to get the diethorn parameters needed for the calculation . \\n + however , the most important point is to compare only pulses with equal drift times for the primary electrons . \\n as can be seen in , the measured pulse height increases with drift time ( with distance from the wire ) . \\n pulses with a short drift time have a lower maximum and a longer tail compared to those with long drift time  although the primary ionisation is lower due to the shorter track length inside the tube . \\n therefore , a cut on the drift time was applied to ensure that only pulses with approximately the same drift distance were compared . \\n +    [ fig = height_tuberad ]    after these cuts , the maximum of each pulse was determined and histogramed . \\n because the muons are minimum ionising particles , the distribution of the pulse heights follows a landau function @xcite which was fitted to the data . \\n this is shown in fig . \\n [ fig = landaufit ] . to describe the distribution of the pulse heights , the most probable pulse height ( which is one parameter of the fit ) was used and not the mean value of the data sample ( which is bigger ) . in the following pulse height \\n means the most probable pulse height of the landau fit . \\n [ fig = height_rate ] shows the behaviour of the pulse height with increasing rate for three different settings of the high voltage , corresponding to gas gains of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 at zero rate . \\n + the solid lines show a calculation of the pulse height using the diethorn formula ( [ eq : gain ] ) to calculate the gain drop . for the calculation of the electric field ( [ eq : newfield ] ) and the actual gain , several iterations of the calculation of @xmath51v ( [ eq : dv ] ) , the gas gain ( [ eq : gain ] ) and the maximum ion drift time ( [ eq : newt+ ] ) are necessary to obtain an accurate value for the charge density @xmath12 ( [ eq : rho ] ) . to compare measured pulse height and calculated gain , one needs to know the ion mobility which was fitted to @xmath52 and found to be consistent with the value of 1.53@xmath53 for ar@xmath54 in ar from @xcite . \\n + one can see that an initially high gas gain drops rather fast with increasing rate , going down to 30% of its initial value at 10khz/@xmath0 . for nominal atlas conditions with a gas gain of 2@xmath55 and photon rates @xmath56100hz/@xmath0 ( corresponding to a muon rate of 200hz/@xmath0 ) the behaviour is rather uncritical , the reduction is some 10% . \\n + however , at very high rates , the pulse height is rather independent of the high voltage , the electric field is reduced to the same limiting value . \\n the order of magnitude of the gain drop with rate is approximately the same for different gases , but the gain drop is larger for gases with low working point ( low high voltage for the same gas gain ) . in that case , the ion drift time is longer and so the space charge density is higher . \\n + the same study was done for the 2 cm and 4 cm tubes . because the primary ionisation of a muon is proportional to its path length inside the tube , the signals of a 4 cm tube are higher than those of 3 cm and 2 cm tubes if all are operated at the same gas gain . in order to compare the behaviour of the different tubes , measurements at the same charge per track ( not at the same gas gain ) at zero rate \\n were compared . for easier comparison , the charge for a 3 cm tube at a gas gain of @xmath57 \\n is set to 1 in fig.[fig = height_tuberad ] . \\n for the 4 cm tube , no measurement was available for charge=1 , so a calculation is shown ( dashed line ) together with a measurement for lower charge . \\n one can clearly see that the gain drop is increasing for bigger tubes at the same irradiation . \\n it is almost negligible for the 2 cm tube , but even for the 4 cm one , the gain drop is in the order of 20% at a muon rate of 1khz/@xmath0 and the nominal gas gain . + the gain reduction could be totally compensated by increasing the high voltage by @xmath51v ( [ eq : dv ] ) corresponding to the actual rate \\n assuming that the irradiation is homogeneous along the tube . \\n the electric field for drifting electrons is changed with rate according to ( [ eq : newfield ] ) . whereas the field changes are more or less the same for different gases at the same rate ( at least if they have to be operated at the same high voltage ) , the effects to the electron drift times are different . the drift time is given by @xmath58 the change in drift time depends on the slope of the drift velocity @xmath59 with the electric field . \\n a gas becomes faster with rate if the slope is positive and slower if it is negative . \\n + one can see here that in order to keep the drift time changes small , one has to look for gases with constant drift velocity , so called linear gases ( linear because in this case , the r - t relation is a straight line ) . \\n [ fig = velo ] shows the drift velocities and the corresponding r - t relations for the three gases that have been studied in this experiment : the linear gases ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% , and ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 94 - 3 - 2 - 1% and the rather non - linear ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% . for comparison \\n , the very non - linear gases ar - co@xmath27 80 - 20% and ar - co@xmath27 are added . \\n + to study the effects of the modified electric field , we look at the change of the maximum electron drift times at different irradiation rates . + the maximum drift time can be calculated using ( [ eq : t_r ] ) with @xmath61 radius of the tube . to do this \\n , one needs to know the drift velocity @xmath62 of the gas mixture . \\n the magboltz @xcite program was used to calculate the drift velocity as a function of the reduced electric field @xmath63 . \\n ( [ eq : newfield ] ) was taken to calculate the correct electric field @xmath64 and then the new r - t relation was integrated using ( [ eq : t_r ] ) . + for using the equation ( [ eq : newfield ] ) the same numbers for the charge density ( and the ion mobility ) were used as for the calculation of the gain drop in the previous section . \\n the calculated maximum drift time is shown as lines in fig . \\n [ fig = drift_calc ] , together with the measured points . \\n + the maximum electron drift time of the measured data can be determined from the falling edge of the distribution of the drift times . because of diffusion and vanishing ionisation at the tube wall , \\n the tail is smeared . to get a precise and reproducible number , a fermi function \\n @xmath65 has been fitted to the distribution ( @xcite ) . \\n the four parameters of the fit are the upper level ( @xmath66 ) , the time at half height ( @xmath67 ) , the slope of the fall ( @xmath68 ) , and an offset ( @xmath69 ) . \\n parameter @xmath67 is taken as the maximum drift time . \\n the physical maximum drift time may be different from this value by a constant offset . \\n however , we are primarily interested in changes of the maximum drift time . \\n an offset between measurement and calculation was fitted and compensated . \\n +    three gases are shown in the left plot of fig.[fig = drift_calc ] for a 3 cm tube : the linear gas ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% , the non - linear gas with the same maximum drift time ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% and the linear gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 94 - 3 - 2 - 1% . \\n for the first one , the maximum drift time is stable up to very high rates with a tendency to increase with rate . \\n the non - linear one shows already differences of several nanoseconds at rather low rates ( ) . for comparing the 2 cm and the 4 cm tubes to our standard 3 cm one , fig.[fig = drift_calc](right ) shows the change of the maximum drift time with rate in each case . \\n + the data points for the 3 cm tube are the same as in the left plot for the gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% . \\n the solid lines show the calculation done in the same way as for the left plot . \\n the datasets used to compute the right plot are the same as those for the right plot of fig.[fig = height_tuberad ] . \\n + as for the gain reduction , one can see here that space charges become more and more important if the tube diameter is increased . \\n the 2 cm tube might be operated with a non - linear gas if that was already considered impracticable for a 3 cm tube . \\n for the 4 cm tube , the drift characteristics are dramatically changed at particle rates of 1khz/@xmath0 or more . \\n it is surely not advisable to use it for high precision measurements at high rates . \\n + surprisingly , both measurement and calculation show that the gas with the most linear r - t relation is not the one that is most insensitive to rate . \\n the reason for this is the fact that the operation point of ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 94 - 3 - 2 - 1% is much lower compared to the others ( 2575v instead of 3300v for ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% and a 3 cm tube . \\n this lower voltage has two effects :    * the amount of space charge is proportional to the inverse of the voltage . \\n @xmath70 because of ( [ eq : rho ] ) and ( [ eq : t+ ] ) . * \\n the relative change of the electric field is proportional to the inverse square of the voltage + + + + @xmath71 because of ( [ eq : newfield ] ) . \\n both points show that an optimum gas should have a high operational voltage . \\n the reason for the rather low working point of this gas is the use of c@xmath27h@xmath60 as quencher . by replacing the ethane with methane , the voltage for the same gas gain will increase by 500v keeping the r - t relation almost unchanged . \\n [ fig = terr ] shows the same calculation as fig . \\n [ fig = drift_calc ] for low rates in a linear scale . \\n additionally , calculations for the gases ar - co@xmath27 80 - 20 % and 90 - 10 % are shown for comparison with non - linear gases . \\n + instead of comparing time shifts it is more adequate to compare the resulting shift in position . \\n [ fig = terr ] bottom shows this position shift ( = the difference between real an assumed position of the particle ) when using the r - t relation suited for rate=0 at the actual rate . \\n this value is plotted for the maximum drift radius ( 1.5 cm ) where for most gases this shift has a maximum . \\n it is much smaller for smaller drift radii . \\n the reason for this is the slope of the drift velocity with the electric field ( fig.[fig = velo ] ) . \\n if it is zero , there is no shift because the drift velocity stays constant . \\n if the slope is monotonous the shift increases with drift radius . \\n this is the case for most gases . for the gas ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% \\n , the slope is very low and the sign changes twice in the relevant range of e / p so the integrated effect is almost zero for the maximum drift distance . + calculating the rms of the values for all radii at given rate leads to fig.[fig = rmserr ] . \\n this is a good measure for comparing the rate behaviour of different gases . \\n typical values are in the order of 50 - 100@xmath1 m for a muon rate of 1khz/@xmath0 , but for linear gases 30@xmath1 m can be reached which is almost negligible compared to the intrinsic resolution of 70@xmath1 m of the tube . +    the position shift does not necessarily decrease the resolution of the drift tube . \\n if the rate is stable , one can calculate an adapted r - t relation where the position shift is compensated . \\n such a r - t relation can be calculated directly from the data with the autocalibration method @xcite . \\n [ fig = rtdiff ] shows the difference between two r - t relations calculated from data at rate=150hz/@xmath0 and rate=1200hz/@xmath0 . \\n in this section we will show that the resolution becomes worse at high particle rates even if one uses the r - t relation with the position shift compensated . \\n it will be shown that the reason for the resolution loss is the fluctuation of the times between two hits which was ignored up to now where only the mean value was taken into account . \\n fig.[fig = zeitvert ] shows that the times between two hits are distributed exponentially . the time constant of the exponential function is defined by the rate . that example for rate @xmath72 80hz/@xmath0 also shows that for roughly half of the events the last hit was more than 4ms ago , which is the time of the ion drift for a 3 cm tube . in that case , all space charges are gone and the tube behaves as if the rate was zero . on the other hand , we know that for a rate of 80hz/@xmath0 , the mean position shift is not negligible for most gases . if the time distance between two events is much shorter than 4ms , one has to take into account all hits within this time window in order to get the correct r - t relation . \\n this is impossible for most applications . \\n + with our setup , it is possible to see the influence of previous hits . \\n fig.[fig = dt_tl ] shows how the maximum drift time depends on the time since the last event passed for the gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% . \\n all tracks were used that were within one cm along the wire coordinate . \\n a tighter cut did not change the behaviour significantly . \\n + the second example ( fig.[fig = ph_dz ] ) shows the pulse height versus the distance @xmath73z along the wire to the previous track . \\n one can clearly see a decrease of the pulse height in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath56 1 mm ) of the previous track , but the effect is very small ( @xmath742% ) . \\n +    for a better understanding of the space charge fluctuations , a simulation study was done and afterwards compared to the measured data . in a first step , \\n it was investigated , how an ion cloud produced at the wire evolves with time in three dimensions . \\n a typical charge cloud consists of 10@xmath75 ions ( primary ion pairs multiplied by gas gain ) . \\n ions were generated near the wire with an initial radial coordinate distributed exponentially within 50@xmath1 m from the wire . \\n the position of the coordinate along the wire ( z ) was distributed like a gaussian with @xmath76 mm . \\n the same was true for the azimuthal angular distribution with @xmath77 . \\n the ions were represented by 1000 points , each one carrying 1/1000 of the total charge . \\n the effective electric field ( coming from the applied voltage and the field of the point charges ) was calculated at each of these points . \\n now , one can calculate the drift velocity of the ions and from this the new position after the time dt . to describe the status of the whole cloud at the time t after creation , the mean value and the rms of the coordinates r , @xmath78 and z were calculated . \\n + in the simulation , the extension of an ion cloud does not exceed @xmath79 mm ) over the whole drift path . \\n but within a z range of 5 mm , field distortions cause changes in the drift time of more than 1ns for non - linear gases ( e.g. ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% ) . on the contrary , for the pulse height ( or the gain ) \\n only the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the wire is relevant . \\n the field distortions coming from an ion cloud that is some mm away are negligible compared to the very high field near the wire . \\n +    in a second step of the simulation , the time distances t@xmath80 between two hits were generated according to the given rate . \\n ions were generated at positions according to the results of step one for all previous tracks within the time of the ion drift . \\n fig [ fig = ioncloud ] gives an example of the distribution of space charges coming from different events . \\n now , electrons were put at radii r=0.5 mm ... \\n r=14.5 mm ( or the respective tube radius for the 2 and 4 cm tubes ) and the drift in the ( static ) field resulting of all relevant space charges and the applied voltage was calculated . \\n the time needed to arrive at the wire was histogramed for each radius \\n . +    fig . \\n [ fig = shiftdemo ] ( left ) shows the distribution of these times for radius=14.5 mm . \\n the right plot shows the position shift resulting from inserting the drift times in the r - t relation ( for rate=0 ) and subtracting the real position where the electron started . \\n the big , narrow peak belongs to tracks where no charges were inside the tube because the last hit was longer than the ion drift time ago . \\n the distributions become more and more gaussian for higher rates . + from the histogram of the position shifts , \\n two parameters are extracted : the mean value which tells how wrong the r - t relation is for the actual rate and the rms which gives the contribution to resolution decrease . \\n this number has to be added quadratically to the resolution of the drift tube at zero rate to get the correct value for the resolution at the investigated rate . \\n +    for comparison with the measurements and the analytical calculation done in the previous section , the mean position shifts for rate=0 ... 1khz/@xmath0 have been calculated ( fig.[fig = shiftsim ] , top ) . \\n they agree within 5% with the values shown in fig . \\n [ fig = terr ] ( bottom ) for the gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% . \\n [ fig = shiftsim ] bottom shows the corresponding rms values of the position shift histogram . \\n this is the contribution to the resolution loss coming from fluctuations . \\n the numbers are non - negligible in the case of high rates and for high precision drift tubes like those of the muon spectrometer for atlas . in that case , the resolution of the tubes is dominated by this effect for a non - linear gas . \\n + calculations of drift chamber properties can be done very precisely using the garfield @xcite program . \\n it also gives reliable numbers for the expected resolution ( at zero rate ) . \\n it was used to compute the resolution of the gases ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% and ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% with parameters discriminator threshold , noise etc set as expected for atlas conditions . \\n the result is shown in fig . \\n [ fig = totres ] ( open circles ) . on the contrary to the results shown before , \\n the gas gain was doubled to @xmath81 in order to have the same amount of space charges at the same rate as expected for the photons of the atlas background . also the measured data that will be shown below \\n refer to muon data with a gas gain of @xmath82 . \\n + the results of the resolution loss for a rate of 500hz/@xmath0 are shown as squares . the total resolution ( filled circles ) \\n is then given as a quadratical sum of both contributions . \\n for the first gas , space charges play an important part for radii @xmath28 8 mm , becoming the dominant contribution . \\n for the second gas , the resolution is not affected by space charges even at very high rates . \\n the different behaviour of the two gases is in agreement with the expectations : fig.[fig = drift_calc ] already showed that the drift time is nearly uneffected due to space charges for ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% . \\n for this linear gas , the drift velocity stays constant with changing electric field - in contrast to the non - linear gas . \\n + an experimental proof of these simulations is shown in figs . \\n [ fig = res129 ] , [ fig = res040 ] . \\n tracks have been fitted through the chamber and the resolution of a single tube was calculated for different conditions . for the gas ar - c@xmath27h@xmath60-n@xmath27-co@xmath27 92 - 3 - 2 - 3% , one can see in both , measurement and simulation a degradation of the resolution for big radii in the case of high rates . \\n it is not visible if one takes only low rate data or  as in shown in fig.[fig = res129](bottom )  selects from a high rate run only those events where the previous track was longer than the ion drift time ago and all space charges are gone . \\n + the degradation of the resolution is also not visible for a

simulation . \\n this is due to the higher noise and a higher threshold for identification of the pulses needed for our flash adcs . \\n the simulation shown refers to tdc measurements as foreseen for atlas . \\n increasing the relevant parameters brings the simulation in accordance with our measurements . \\n + finally , the expected resolution of 2 , 3 , and 4 cm tubes shall be compared using a non - linear gas ( for a linear one , the differences are mostly negligible in all cases ) . \\n the 3 cm results are shown in fig.[fig = totres ] , the others in fig.[fig = totres24 ] . \\n the 2 cm tube is nearly unaffected by the high irradiation , a resolution loss occurs only in the last 2 mm . on the contrary , for a 4 cm tube \\n the resolution is dominated by the space charge contribution and the mean spatial resolution becomes much worse than 100@xmath1 m . \\n gain reduction and changes of drift times have been measured as a function of the rate . for the gases that have been tested , \\n a good agreement between measurements and calculation was found . \\n predictions of the high rate behaviour for new gases can be made without performing measurements . + the gas gain reduction due to space charges is similar for most gases and unavoidable . for a constant rate \\n it could be compensated by increasing the high voltage . \\n + the electric field for drifting electrons is increased because of space charges for radii larger than 4 mm ( in a 3 cm tube ) . for linear gases ( like ar - ch@xmath26-n@xmath27 91 - 5 - 4% ) \\n this may have almost no effect on the r - t relation even at very high rates . for non - linear ones \\n there are already big effects at rates of 100hz/@xmath0 . \\n whereas the r - t relation can be adapted for a given irradiation rate , it is ( for practical applications ) impossible to correct for the field fluctuations resulting from the random distribution of the times between two hits . \\n this gives a contribution to the total resolution of the drift tube which for non - linear gases becomes the dominant limitation of the spatial resolution at large distances from the wire . \\n we would like to thank our colleagues from the atlas muon collaboration , especially the people from the test beam group for their support and many helpful discussions at any time of the day or night . \\n special thanks to rob veenhof for

The calculation is performed using a two-step phenomenological approach. In the first step,\\n\\nThis is a list of the authors of a paper on neutrino production of charm.', \"recent sets of global parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) have reached a sufficiently high level of accuracy that quantization and propagation of statistical errors have become important issues . \\n it is , therefore , even more unsettling that the strange quark pdf , @xmath0 , remains a mystery without a fully consistent picture emerging from the comparative analysis between neutrino and muon structure functions , opposite sign dimuon production in @xmath1-dis , or the recently measured parity violating structure function @xmath2 . given the high precision of the non - strange pdf components , this situation for @xmath0 is unacceptable both in terms of our understanding of the nucleon structure , and for our ability to use precise flavor information to make predictions for present and future experiments .    for extracting the strange quark pdf , the dimuon production data in nu - fe dis provide the most direct determination . \\n the basic channel is the weak charged current process @xmath3 with a subsequent charm decay @xmath4 . \\n these events provide a direct probe of the @xmath5-vertex , and hence the strange quark pdf . \\n in contrast , single muon production only provides indirect information about @xmath0 which must then be extracted from a linear combination of structure functions in the context of the qcd parton model . for this reason , fixed - target neutrino dimuon production will provide a unique perspective on the strange quark distribution of the nucleon in the foreseeable future . \\n in contrast , hera provides a large dynamic range in @xmath6 for the cp conjugated process @xmath7 which is valuable for testing the underlying qcd evolution . within the hermes experimental program the flavor structure of the polarized and unpolarized sea \\n are studied from semi - inclusive dis where dis - kaon production has obvious potential to probe strangeness . in summary , hera and hermes can complement fixed - target neutrino dimuon data with information at different energies and from different processes ; therefore , neutrino dis serves , for now , as an important benchmark process to perform rigorous and refined comparisons between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations . in the long run , a high luminosity neutrino factory could , of course , considerably raise the accuracy of present day information from @xmath8-dis . \\n the theoretical calculations of inclusive charged current charm production have been carefully studied in the literature . \\n additionally , the charm fragmentation spectrum has also been calculated in detail . while inclusive calculations are sufficient for many tasks , a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data at nlo requires additional information from the theoretical side . in \\n charged current @xmath8-fe charm production , the detector acceptance depends on the full range of kinematic variables : @xmath9 . \\n here , @xmath10 is the bjorken-@xmath10 , @xmath11 is the virtuality of the @xmath12-boson , @xmath13 is the scaled energy of the charm after fragmentation , and @xmath14 is the charm rapidity . \\n the theoretical task is , _ mutatis mutandis _ \\n , not too different from the extraction of the neutral current charm structure function @xmath15 as performed by the hera experiments ; the hera analysis uses the theoretical calculation of the differential cross section to extrapolate into regions of poor acceptance .    in this short report,@xcite \\n we briefly discuss the key factors that influence the acceptance of the experimental detector , review the theoretical calculation of the fully differential cross section at nlo in qcd , and present numerical results for typical fixed target kinematics . \\n dimuon events from neutrino charged current charm production can provide a clear set of events from which to study the strange sea . their signiture in a detector is a pair of oppositely charged muons and hadronic shower originating from the same vertex . the second muon is produced in the semileptonic decay of the charmed particle . in order to properly reconstruct these events from data , \\n a minimum energy requirement must be applied to this muon . to be visible at all \\n , it must first be energetic enough that it travels further in the detector than the particles which make up the hadronic shower . \\n the background from muons from nonprompt decays of pions and kaons within the shower is large at low energy , and must also be reduced . \\n typically a cut on the charm decay muon s energy of a few gev is applied to guarantee it is reconstructable , and reduce the nonprompt backgrounds . \\n this energy requirement leads to a dependence on variables in addition to the typical @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 or @xmath18 dependence of the charged current cross section . \\n the energy of the decay muon depends on the energy of the charmed meson from which it decays , and therefore depends on the fragmentation parameter @xmath13 . in nlo \\n , it also depends on the transverse momentum of the charmed quark . \\n an event with a low @xmath13 , and/or high transverse momentum will be less likely to pass a cut on the decay muon s energy than one with a high @xmath13 and no transverse momentum . \\n it is therefore important that the charm production cross section s dependence on these variables be understood for a monte carlo to be able to model dimuon event acceptance properly . \\n recorded charged - current charm production rates must be corrected for the detector acceptance which , as discussed above , depends on the full range of kinematic variables @xmath19 . \\n therefore , we must obtain the nlo theoretical cross section which is completely differential in all these variables . as the nlo theoretical cross section contains @xmath20-function distributions and `` plus''-distributions , \\n there are many inherent difficulties combining this program with a complex detector simulation mc program . \\n the singular distributions are nothing but an unphysical artifact of regularized perturbation theory ; for any physically observable quantity , these singularities will be smeared by soft gluon emission to yield physical c - number distributions . \\n as the theoretical machinery of soft gluon resummation is not fully developed for semi - inclusive dis ( massive ) heavy quark production , we will use a two step phenomenological approach : 1 )  we regularize the nlo calculation to provide numerical distributions free of @xmath20-function and `` plus''-distributions by integrating over bins which reflect the finite resolution of the experimental detector . \\n 2 )  this result is input to a monte carlo ( mc ) where additional effects , including iterated soft gluon emissions are added to the @xmath21 smearing from nlo kinematics to match a gaussian distribution that has been fit to data . \\n in addition to the above complications , we also encounter large and negative sudakov logarithms close to the phase space boundary where , at fixed - order , soft single - gluon emission is enhanced . \\n these sudakov logarithms diverge in the limit of zero bin - width ; as we increase our resolution via narrow binning , we begin to resolve the unphysical @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions . '' \\n conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results . \\n having addressed the complication of mapping mathematical distributions onto c - number functions by the introduction of bins , we now present some preliminary results of step  1 ) of this calculation . \\n we compute the normalized differential charm production cross section for the differential structure function with the binning procedure defined above .    for our variables , \\n we choose the set @xmath22 where @xmath14 is the charm rapidity evaluated in the collinear ( @xmath23 ) target rest frame . in we present results for kinematics typical of a wide - band neutrino beam on a fixed target : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . \\n we plot @xmath27 in 2-dimensions _ vs. _ \\n @xmath13 and @xmath14 in -a . -b and -c show @xmath28 for the case where either @xmath14 or @xmath13 is integrated out . in both cases \\n , we display this for fine - binnings of 1@xmath29100 or 100@xmath291 , and broad - binnings of 1@xmath295 or 10@xmath291 . as an important cross - check on these results \\n , we verify that the binning @xmath30 ( rapidity integrated out ) reproduces the integrated results in the literature . \\n we observe negative sudakov logarithms which occur at large @xmath13 where we have @xmath31 in the integrand . \\n this effect is an artifact of our fixed - order result , and is clearly evident in -b where we see that in the case of fine binning and large @xmath13 , the distribution turns negative . \\n the fine binning effectively resolves the unphysical @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions , '' and results in an unphysical negative distribution . \\n conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results . in an actual experimental analysis , \\n this requirement of broad bins arises naturally given the finite detector resolution . \\n hence , we observe that negative weights can be easily avoided by using sufficiently broad bins in a reasonable broadening of the binning    our use of bins to regularize the differential distributions will have negligible impact on the experimental analysis because our bin size is small compared to the experimental detector resolution , and also because the detector acceptance is a smooth function in terms of the set of kinematic variables . in particular , given the geometry of typical neutrino detectors , the effective experimental bin size in @xmath13 and @xmath14 is _ comfortably _ large enough for the purpose of regularizing the differential distributions with the binning technique . \\n in conclusion , we have presented a fully differential nlo calculation of the neutrino - induced dis charm production process . \\n this calculation is an essential ingredient for a complete analysis of the dimuon data , and will allow a precise determination of the strange quark pdf . \\n we have demonstrated that by binning the data appropriately , we can interface the theoretical calculation ( containing @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions '' ) directly to the experimental monte carlo analysis program . \\n we observe the enhancement of the sudakov logarithms at the phase - space boundaries , and verify that these can be controlled with this binning method . \\n the fully differential distributions obtained here allow charged current neutrino dis experiments to use the complete nlo qcd result in the monte carlo data analysis . \\n this analysis using the nutev data is in progress . \\n these tools will allow us to extract the strange quark pdf from the dimuon data at nlo with unprecedented accuracy ;

dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations and particle - in - cell ( pic ) kinetic simulations that for a large system with weak collisions , the secondary tearing instability leads to fractal reconnection layers with chains of plasmoids developed and the reconnection rate can be independent of the lundquist number @xcite . \\n however , effects like mhd turbulence and 3d physics that could be important to the physics of magnetic reconnection have not been fully understood to reach a consensus @xcite .    in astrophysical problems such as solar flares , pulsar wind nebula , and relativistic jets in gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei , magnetic reconnection \\n is often invoked to explain high - energy emissions from the strongly magnetized flows @xcite . for relativistic plasmas , it is useful to define the magnetization parameter @xmath6 , which indicates the ratio of the energy density of the magnetic field to the rest energy density of the plasma . for nonrelativistic plasmas , it is more appropriate to use plasma beta @xmath7 that represents the ratio between plasma thermal energy to magnetic energy . in high - energy astrophysics \\n , it is often estimated that the magnetization parameter can be much greater than unity @xmath8(or @xmath9 ) and the alfv@xmath10n speed approaches the speed of light @xmath11 . to explain the observed high - energy emissions , often an efficient mechanism from energies in the magnetized flow into nonthermal particles is required ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ; * ? ? ? \\n * ) . in the high-@xmath3 regime , \\n magnetic reconnection is the major candidate for converting magnetic energy and producing nonthermal particles and radiations . for a number of other systems such as solar corona and disk corona @xcite , although the alfv@xmath10n speed is not relativistic , the magnetic energy can greatly exceed the plasma thermal energy so @xmath9 . during magnetic reconnection a large fraction of the magnetic energy can be unleashed explosively into plasmas within a short time typically on the order of the alfv@xmath10n crossing time . \\n much of the recent progress on particle energization during reconnection has been made through first -

line region @xcite and along the separatrix region @xcite , particles can get accelerated in the nonideal electric field and then further accelerated due to grad - b drift and the curvature drift in the magnetic pileup region @xcite , where the electric field is mostly ideal @xmath13 . @xcite \\n have further developed the fermi mechanism inside the magnetic islands as particles get bounced at two ends of islands repeatedly @xcite . \\n @xcite summarized a number of basic acceleration mechanisms and concluded that island coalecensce region is an important acceleration site . in these regions \\n the reconnected flux ropes interact and create new reconnection sites . for a large - scale reconnection layer that contains multiple x - points , the acceleration is more complicated and needs to be studied in a collective manner . @xcite and \\n @xcite have shown that , for a large - scale kinetic simulations that contain multiple x - regions , statistically the curvature drift acceleration along the reconnecting electric field is the dominant acceleration when the guide field is weak . \\n the nonideal electric field only contributes to a small fraction of energy conversion in the simulation . \\n the effect of a guide field that is normal to the reconnection plane can significantly alter the dominant acceleration mechanism @xcite . \\n it should be noted that in situ observations at the magnetotail have found evidence for those acceleration mechanisms . \\n although energetic particles associated with diffusion regions have been discovered and detected by spacecraft observation @xcite , the flux ropes appear to be a stronger sources of energetic electrons @xcite . \\n betatron acceleration and fermi acceleration are found to be important acceleration mechanism further away from the x - points @xcite . \\n initial kinetic simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection have found that strongly nonthermal distributions can be generated at the x - line region through direct acceleration in the diffusion region @xcite . \\n while particles get further accelerated in the magnetic pileup regions , the overall energy distribution in the whole domain does not show obvious power - law distributions @xcite . over the past few years \\n , several groups have reported hard power - law distributions @xmath14 when @xmath8 @xcite . \\n these new simulations found power - law distributions in the whole reconnection region , suggesting reconnection in magnetically - dominated regime may be a strong source of nonthermally energetic charged particles . \\n while these results appear to be repeatedly confirmed , the dominant acceleration mechanism and the formation mechanism for the power - law distribution are still under debate . through tracing the guiding - center drift motions of particles in pic simulations , \\n @xcite have shown that the dominant acceleration mechanism is a first - order fermi mechanism through curvature drift motions of particles in the electric field induced by the reconnection generated flows . by considering an energy continuity equation \\n , it has been shown that a power - law distribution can be generated when a continuous injection and fermi acceleration @xmath15 are considered . \\n the solution also gives a general condition for the formation of the power - law particle energy distribution , i.e. , the acceleration time scale is shorter than the time scale for particles injected into the reconnection region @xmath16 . \\n this mechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power - law spectra @xmath17 with spectral index approaching @xmath18 for a sufficiently high @xmath3 and a large system size . \\n following this work , the power - law distribution has also been reported in nonrelativistic reconnection simulation with a low-@xmath2 proton - electron plasma @xcite , indicating the power - law distribution can develop in a larger parameter regime than previous expected high-@xmath3 regime . in the simulations with magnetically - dominated proton - electron plasmas , both electrons and protons \\n develop significant power - law distributions @xcite . on the other hand \\n , @xcite argued that the initial nonthermal energization at the x - line regions is crucial for the generation of the power - law distribution @xcite . in the vicinity of the x - lines , \\n the initial distribution is energized into a nonthermal distribution even flatter than the overall distribution but with a limited energy range . \\n this nonthermal distribution gets further accelerated in flux ropes to eventually develop into the observed spectra @xcite . @xcite \\n have shown statistically that the acceleration in the island merging region is a dominant source of nonthermal acceleration . \\n however , the analysis is mostly based on the acceleration site rather than the acceleration mechanism . \\n kinetic studies of magnetic reconnection have shown that current layers with thicknesses on the order of kinetic scales \\n skin depth @xmath19 or thermal gyroradius @xmath20  are subject to reconnection . \\n we assume a situation where intense current sheets develop within a magnetically dominated plasma . \\n this can be achieved through various processes such as striped wind geometry @xcite , field - line foot - point motion @xcite , and turbulence cascade @xcite . during reconnection , \\n the critical parameters that quantify the energization in the current layer are the magnetization parameter @xmath21 and plasma beta @xmath22 . \\n the numerical simulations presented in this paper are initialized from a force - free current layer with @xmath23 @xcite , corresponding to a magnetic field with magnitude @xmath24 rotating by @xmath25 across the central layer with a half - thickness of @xmath26 . \\n the initial distributions are maxwellian with a spatially uniform density @xmath27 and thermal temperature @xmath28 . \\n particles in the central sheet have a net drift @xmath29 to represent a current density @xmath30 that is consistent with @xmath31 . \\n since the force - free current sheet does not require a hot plasma component to balance the lorentz force , this initial setup may be more suitable to study reconnection in low @xmath2 and/or high-@xmath3 plasmas . \\n we have also used relativistic harris current sheet @xcite and found the two initial setup generally gives similar results , although the hot plasma component in general results in a maxwellian - like distribution that may dominate over the nonthermal distribution .    in our present simulations , \\n we assume plasma consists of electron - positron pairs with mass ratio @xmath32 . \\n no external guide field is included but there is an intrinsic guide field associated with the central sheet for the force - free setup . during the evolution the guide field will be expelled from the layer into the flux rope / island regions and later the current sheet closely resembles antiparallel reconnection @xcite . in this study , we vary the initial thermal temperature to examine its influence on the resulting energy spectra . this has not been fully examined in previous papers . \\n the full particle simulations are performed using the vpic code @xcite , which explicitly solve maxwell equations and push particles in a relativistic manner . in the simulations , @xmath3 is adjusted by changing the ratio of the electron gyrofrequency @xmath33 to the electron plasma frequency @xmath34 , @xmath35 . \\n we primarily focus on 2d simulations with @xmath36 and box sizes @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath19 is the inertial length @xmath40 . \\n we also show a 3d simulation that discussed previously @xcite . \\n the 3d simulation has dimensions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . \\n the half -

law distribution using pic simulations , the dominant acceleration mechanism and the formation mechanism for the power - law distributions have not reached a consensus ( see section 2 for a discussion ) . \\n two main possibilities discussed in the literature are direct acceleration by the nonideal electric field in the diffusion region @xcite and fermi - like acceleration in the electric field induced by the motion of the reconnection driven flows @xcite . \\n further efforts are required to distinguish the relative importance of the two ( or other ) mechanisms and their roles in the formation of power - law distribution and determining the final spectral index .      because of the level of computational cost , most of the kinetic studies of magnetic reconnection have been focusing on two - dimensional studies . \\n there have been only a few 3d kinetic simulations of sufficient scale to allow a realistic interaction between various modes . \\n for example , it has been shown that the oblique tearing modes and kink modes develop and interact each other , leading to a turbulent reconnection layer @xcite . \\n however , those simulations have found about the same reconnection rate compare to 2d studies , indicating the 3d effects do not significantly alter the reconnection rate , although what determines the reconnection rate found in kinetic simulations is still a controversial topic . \\n while early simulations show that kink instability may prohibit the nonthermal acceleration @xcite , recent large scale simulations have shown that nonthermal acceleration can still develop despite the growth of the kink instability @xcite . \\n it will be interesting to analyze the effects of 3d physics to different acceleration mechanisms for the nonthermal acceleration . \\n a closely related topic is the influence of turbulence on reconnection . \\n the effects of mhd turbulence on the reconnection physics and the acceleration of particles have not been fully understood . \\n several numerical studies have shown that magnetic turbulence can develop from a three - dimensional reconnection layer , but the evidence that the turbulence has strong effect on reconnection physics is still missing . \\n it will also be interesting to study if the self - excited or externally driven turbulence will significantly change the mechanism for nonthermal particle acceleration .      in agreement with other recent papers \\n @xcite , this work shows that the spectral index in simulation is often much harder than commonly observed in space and inferred from astrophysical emissions . \\n although there is some observational evidence in support of the hard spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \\n * ) , the power - law index predicted by the pic simulation is systematically harder than most observations . \\n more seriously , for a power - law spectrum with spectral index @xmath80 , the total energy contained in the distribution quickly increases with particle energy . \\n this limits the maximum energy in the power - law predicted from the available magnetic energy . \\n we have analytically shown that allowing particle escape from the reconnection region will produce a steeper spectrum @xcite . \\n however , most of the kinetic simulations so far have used periodic boundary conditions . \\n nevertheless , these recent results suggest that it is important to consider the effects that can lead to a softer spectrum such as open boundary simulations in the future . \\n this work is supported by the doe through the ldrd program at lanl , doe / ofes support to lanl in collaboration with cmso , and by nasa through the heliospheric theory program . \\n is supported by nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space science fellowship program \\n grant nnx13am30h . \\n the research is part of the blue waters sustained -

The first publication is titled \"b. dual and dual-primal feti methods for elliptic problems with discontinuous', 'elastoplastic processes describe behaviour of solid continuum beyond reversible elastic deformations . \\n they are typically described by hysteresis models with a time memory @xcite . \\n the rigorous mathematical analysis of elastoplastic problems and the numerical methods for their solution started to appear in the late 70ies and in the early 80ies by the work of c. johnson @xcite , h. matthies @xcite , v. korneev and u. langer @xcite , j. neas and i. hlavek @xcite and others . \\n since then a lot of mathematical contributions to computational plasticity have been written , we refer at least to the monographs by j. simo and t. hughes @xcite and w. han and b. reddy @xcite . in this paper \\n , we focus on the efficient parallel implementation of elastoplastic problems based on the tfeti domain decomposition method @xcite . \\n more specifically , we consider an associated elastoplasticity with the von mises plastic criterion and the linear isotropic hardening law ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \\n the corresponding elastoplastic constitutive model is discretized by the implicit euler method in time and consequently a nonlinear stress - strain relation is implemented by the return mapping concept ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \\n this approach together with the balance equation , the small strain assumption and a combination of the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions leads to the solution of a nonlinear variational equation with respect to the primal unknown displacement in each time step . \\n such an equation can also be equivalently formulated as a minimization problem with a potential energy functional ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    by a finite element space discretization of the one time step problem \\n , we obtain a system of nonlinear equations . \\n the corresponding nonlinear operator is nondifferentiable but strongly semismooth . \\n therefore , it is suitable to choose the semismooth newton method for solving the system since the strong semismoothness together with other properties ensure local quadratic convergence . \\n semismooth functions in finite dimensional spaces and the semismooth newton method were introduced in @xcite . in elastoplasticity \\n , the semismoothness was investigated for example in @xcite .    in each newton iteration , it is necessary to solve the respective linearized problem . different linear solvers including those based on multigrid \\n have been successfully tested in @xcite . moreover , since the linear systems of equations corresponding to the elastic and elastoplastic problems are spectrally equivalent @xcite , all preconditioners for elastic problems can be applied to elastoplastic ones as well . \\n a linear solver considered in this paper is based on a feti type domain decomposition method enabling its efficient parallel implementation . \\n the standard feti method ( feti-1 ) was originally introduced by farhat and roux @xcite and theoretically analyzed by mandel and tezaur @xcite . \\n a systematic overview of using this approach , a body is partitioned into non - overlapping subdomains , an elliptic problem with neumann boundary conditions is defined for each subdomain , and intersubdomain field continuity is enforced via lagrange multipliers . \\n the lagrange multipliers are efficiently solved from a dual problem by a variant of the conjugate gradient algorithm . \\n the first practical implementations exploited only the favorable distribution of the spectrum of the matrix of the smaller problem @xcite , known also as the dual schur complement matrix , but such algorithm was efficient only with a small number of subdomains . \\n later , farhat , mandel , and roux introduced a `` natural coarse problem \\'\\' whose solution was implemented by auxiliary projectors so that the resulting algorithm became in a sense optimal @xcite . here \\n , we use the total - feti ( tfeti ) @xcite variant of feti domain decomposition method , where even the dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced by lagrange multipliers . \\n hence all subdomain stiffness matrices are singular with a - priori known kernels which is a great advantage in the numerical solution . with known kernel basis \\n we can regularize effectively the stiffness matrix without extra fill in and use any standard sparse cholesky type decomposition method for nonsingular matrices @xcite .    for systematic overview of domain decomposition methods we refer to @xcite . \\n we mention feti - dp and bddc methods as examples of alternatives to the total - feti method . \\n the feti - dp ( dual - primal feti ) is a popular way of avoiding singular stiffness matrices of the local problems and was first introduced by farhat , lesoinne , le tallec , pierson , and rixen @xcite . on the other hand , in @xcite we gave numerical examples showing that the matrices of the systems arising in tfeti may be better conditioned than those arising in feti - dp . \\n more theoretical and implementation details about feti - dp and its extensions and improvements are given in @xcite . \\n the bddc ( balancing domain decomposition by constraints ) was introduced by dohrmann @xcite as a simpler primal alternative to the feti - dp . \\n the name of the method was coined by mandel and dohrmann @xcite , because it can be understood as further development of the bdd ( balancing domain decomposition ) method @xcite . \\n an alternative approach to the solution of elastoplastic problems based on the schwarz domain decomposition method with overlap was introduced in @xcite . \\n the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce a quasistatic scheme of a solid mechanics problem . within this context \\n , we consider both elastic and elastoplastic models . \\n the elastic model is introduced for methodical purposes because it is an essential part of the investigated elastoplastic model . \\n after its time discretization we summarize the resulting one time step problem . in section 3 , \\n the finite element space discretization of the one time step problem and its nonlinear algebraic formulation are described in details . \\n the semismooth newton method is applied to treat this nonlinearity . \\n the tfeti method combined with the projected conjugate gradient algorithm is derived in section 4 to solve the linearized problems appearing in the newton iterations . \\n finally , the algorithm for solving the whole elastoplastic problem is summarized . in section 5 , the performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on numerical experiments . \\n final comments are summarized in section 6 . \\n in this section , we summarize elastic and elastoplastic models in a quasistatic framework . \\n firstly , we introduce basic notation and assumptions that will be used for setting the models . \\n secondly , we describe the linear elastic constitutive model for an isotropic material . \\n thirdly , we introduce the elastoplastic initial value constitutive model based on the described elasticity , the von mises yield function , the associated plastic flow rule and the linear isotropic hardening represented by the accumulated plastic strain . \\n fourthly , we consider time discretization of the constitutive model given by the implicit euler method \\n . the explicit form of the time discretized elastoplastic operator is introduced . \\n let us consider a deformable body occupying a domain

[ c - prop ] ) and the korn inequality @xcite , @xmath42 is symmetric and @xmath40-elliptic @xmath43 the mentioned properties of the form @xmath44 ensure that the elastic problem ( [ weak - elast ] ) has a unique solution @xmath45 , for example by lax - milgram lemma @xcite . \\n notice that the problem ( [ weak - elast ] ) does not depend on the load history , so it is a static problem .      in comparison to elasticity ( see ) , elastoplasticity is a time - dependent model where the history of loading is taken into account . \\n we will assume associated elastoplasticity with von mises plastic criterion and linear isotropic hardening law ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \\n for details on more complicated hardening laws we refer for instance to @xcite . \\n the elastoplastic initial - value constitutive model consists of the following components : + 1 . \\n additive decomposition of the strain tensor into the elastic and plastic parts : @xmath46    \\\\2 . \\n linear elastic law between

@xmath71 , subject to the constraints @xmath72 this constitutive problem can be solved explicitly by the return mapping concept ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \\n it means that we firstly apply the elastic predictor , i.e. , we verify whether @xmath73 . \\n if it holds then @xmath74 i.e. , the stress increment satisfies the elastic law defined by . if @xmath75 , then by the plastic corrector we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 notice that the second formula in ( [ plast_corr ] ) is correctly defined since the denominator @xmath78 for @xmath75 \\n . let us define the stress and hardening operators @xmath79 , @xmath80 with respect to parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , such that for @xmath33 @xmath83 respectively , where @xmath84 denotes the positive part of the function @xmath85 . then by ( [

@xmath87 with respect to the current parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 by @xmath88 . by @xcite , the operator @xmath89 is potential , lipschitz continuous , strongly monotone , and strongly semismooth on @xmath26 .    let us note that semismoothness was originally introduced by mifflin @xcite for functionals . \\n qi and j. sun @xcite extended the definition of semismoothness to vector - valued function to investigate the superlinear convergence of the newton method . \\n the strong semismoothness of the lipschitz continuous function @xmath88 means that @xmath88 is directionally differentiable on @xmath26 and has a quadratic approximate property at any @xmath33 , i.e. , for any @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and any @xmath92 , @xmath93 here @xmath94 denotes the set of the clark generalized derivatives of @xmath95 at @xmath96 . here \\n we will choose the clark generalized derivative @xmath97 of @xmath95 in the following way :    \\\\1 . if @xmath98 , then @xmath99    \\\\2 . \\n if @xmath100 , then @xmath101 where @xmath102 notice that @xmath95 is not differentiable at @xmath33 , @xmath103 . otherwise @xmath104 . \\n by using ( [ hook_law])([vol - dev_prop ] ) , ( [ stress_op_deriv_elast ] ) and ( [ stress_op_deriv_plast ] ) we can derive the following uniform estimate for @xmath97 ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath105    let us recall that the stress , strain , hardening and displacement variables also depend on a spatial variable @xmath106 . \\n we consider the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath108 in the following sense : @xmath109 then we can substitute the stress operator @xmath95 , defined by ( [ stress_op ] ) , into the balance equation ( [ weak - balance ] ) to obtain the time discretized elastoplastic problem in the incremental form . \\n [

, we will solve a linearized problem in each newton iteration . to do this \\n , it will be useful to define the bilinear form @xmath121 for @xmath45 by @xmath122 where the operator @xmath123 is defined by ( [ stress_op_deriv_elast ] ) and ( [ stress_op_deriv_plast ] ) . \\n the bilinear form @xmath124 is symmetric , bounded , and @xmath40-elliptic on @xmath40 due to ( [ t_k^o - est ] ) and ( [ a_e - est ] ) . \\n in this section , firstly , we approximate the time discretized elastoplastic problem by the finite element method and introduce the corresponding algebraic notation . \\n secondly , we introduce the semismooth newton method for the problem . \\n details to finite element implementation of elastoplastic problems can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    for the sake of simplicity , \\n we assume a polyhedral 3d domain @xmath20 and use the linear simplex elements . the corresponding shape regular triangulation is denoted by @xmath125 . \\n thus the space @xmath40 is approximated by its subspace @xmath126 of piecewise linear and continuous functions \\n . therefore the spaces of the strains , the stress and the isotropic hardening are approximated by piecewise constant functions . \\n similarly to ( [ weak - plast ] ) , ( [ weak - plast2 ] ) , we can formulate the one time step elastoplastic problem after the space discretization . \\n let @xmath127 , @xmath128 be piecewise constant stress and hardening variables with respect to the triangulation @xmath125 at the time @xmath65 obtained from a previous time process . \\n _ find the displacement

@xmath119 from the relations @xmath135 for every elements of @xmath136 . \\n _    for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider finite element approximation of @xmath137 and @xmath138 . \\n similarly as in ( [ stress_op_deriv_elast ] ) and ( [ stress_op_deriv_plast ] ) , we can define the generalized derivative @xmath139 of @xmath140 and consequently also define the approximated bilinear form @xmath141 for @xmath142 by @xmath143    each function @xmath144 can be represented by a vector @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the number of vertices of the triangulation @xmath125 and @xmath147 . \\n the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition is represented by a restriction matrix @xmath148 , i.e. , @xmath149 let @xmath150 be a restriction operator for a displacement vector @xmath151 on a local element @xmath152 , i.e. , @xmath153 we denote by @xmath154 and @xmath155 the displacement vector and the searching displacement increment at the time step @xmath156 , respectively . \\n we denote the load vector represented the volume and surface forces @xmath157 by @xmath158 and its increment @xmath159 . \\n further , we use a vector representation in @xmath160 of the stress and strain tensors that is typical for an implementation of elastic problem , i.e. , @xmath161 notice that the stress and strain vectors have different structures in comparison to the above tensor notation . \\n therefore we must carefully distinguish this difference in algebraic representation of the operators @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath140 , and @xmath139 . \\n the vectors in sense of stress variables will be denoted by letters @xmath164 , @xmath165 , the vectors in sense of strain variables will be denoted by letters @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 . \\n let @xmath170 and @xmath171 be the algebraic representation of @xmath127 and @xmath128 on an element @xmath172 , respectively . \\n we introduce the algebraic representations @xmath173 , @xmath174 ,

respect to the vector form ( [ stress_strain_vector ] ) of the stress and strain variables . \\n the forms of matrices @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and the norm @xmath176 are @xmath189 ,

in the following way : @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath195 respectively \\n .    we also introduce the matrix @xmath196 representing the algebraical relation between the strain and the displacement ( the exact form of @xmath197 is in @xcite ) , \\n i.e. , the strain @xmath198 on an element @xmath172 can be found by ( [ displ_restr ] ) in the form @xmath199    based on the introduced notation we define the non - linear operator @xmath200 , @xmath201 which plays the role of the left hand side in ( [ weak - plast_h ] ) . \\n further we define the tangential and elastic stiffness matrices @xmath202 which represent the bilinear forms @xmath203 and @xmath44 , respectively . \\n in particular , we denote the matrix @xmath204 briefly by @xmath205 , where the reason of @xmath206 will be explained in the next section . \\n let @xmath207 then by using ( [ f_def ] ) , we can rewrite the equation ( [ weak - plast_h ] ) as follows : find @xmath208 such that @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the increment of the load vector . \\n let @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 denote the restrictions of @xmath154 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 given by omitting the entries ( degrees of freedom ) corresponding to the prescribed dirichlet boundary conditions . \\n then we can rewrite the equation ( [ weak - plast_alg ] ) to the following system of non - linear equations : @xmath218 the discretized elastoplastic problem can be solved by the following algorithm :    1.2    initial step : @xmath219 for any @xmath172 find @xmath208 : @xmath220 @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223      the non - linear system of equations ( [ non_system ] ) is solved by the semismooth newton method ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \\n the corresponding algorithm is following :    1.2    initialization : @xmath224 find @xmath225 : @xmath226 compute @xmath227 set @xmath228    here @xmath229 is the relative stopping tolerance and @xmath230 is the restriction of @xmath231 given by omitting the entries ( degrees of freedom ) corresponding to the prescribed dirichlet boundary conditions . \\n since ( [ t_k^o - est ] ) yields @xmath232 the matrices @xmath233 are spectrally equivalent to @xmath234 . by @xcite \\n , it means that all types of preconditioners for elastic problems can be applied to the linearized problem in each newton step as well . \\n if @xmath235 , we obtain the elastic - perfectly plastic problem , and @xmath236 become generally singular . \\n such a problem is complicated not only for computations but also for the complete theory in terms of displacements . \\n therefore , the mentioned spectral equivalency seems to be problematic for too small values of @xmath237 . \\n however , most of local stiffness matrices used in assembly of @xmath236 remain in an elastic mode and @xmath236 become more regular in real computations . \\n indeed , we have successfully used the introduced algorithms even for perfectly plastic case @xcite .    in @xcite , superlinear local convergence of the algorithm has been derived . \\n let us note that the convergence depends on the discretization parameter @xmath238 of the triangulation . \\n therefore we can expect that the finer the mesh , the bigger the number of the newton iterations . in @xcite , a damped semismoooth newton method for such \\n a problem has also been described . \\n such a method has again superlinear local convergence and additionally global convergence . \\n in this section , we describe the tfeti domain decomposition method for solving linearized problems appearing in newton iterations and its optimal solver based on projected conjugate gradient method with preconditioning ( pcgp ) . \\n finally , we summarize tfeti based algorithm for solving the whole elastoplastic problem .      in the previous section , we showed that we need to solve the following system of the linear equations : @xmath239 in each time step @xmath156 and in each newton iteration @xmath240 . \\n since the tfeti domain decomposition method can be described independently of the indices @xmath241 , we will schematically write the problem in the form : @xmath242 where @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 are the restriction of @xmath246 with respect to the dirichlet boundary conditions respectively . \\n let us note that @xmath247 is a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix and @xmath243 is a symmetric and positive definite matrix . \\n therefore the linearized problem ( [ linear_system2 ] ) has a unique solution . \\n the problem ( [ linear_system2 ] ) can be equivalently rewritten as a minimization problem : @xmath248 where @xmath249    the corresponding functional representation of ( [ linear_system2 ] ) is following : find @xmath142 such that for any @xmath250 , @xmath251 where @xmath252 restricted on @xmath172 is a constant fourth order symmetric and elliptic tensor and @xmath253 restricted on @xmath254 is a constant second order tensor from @xmath26 . \\n we can see that ( [ weak_discr ] ) is related to ( [ linear_system ] ) , if we replace @xmath255 and set @xmath256 and @xmath257 as the functional representation of @xmath258 and @xmath259 , respectively . \\n notice that the problem ( [ weak_discr ] ) has a similar scheme as the elastic problem defined in subsection [ subsection_elast_model ] . therefore the below introduced tfeti method can also be explained for elasticity in the same way .    the variational problem of the type ( [ weak_discr ] ) \\n can be equivalently formulated as a minimization problem : @xmath260 where @xmath261    to apply the tfeti domain decomposition , we tear the body from the part of the boundary with the dirichlet boundary condition , decompose it into subdomains , assign each subdomain by a unique number , and introduce new `` gluing \\'\\' conditions on the artificial intersubdomain boundaries and on the boundaries with imposed dirichlet condition ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . \\n in particular , the polyhedral domain @xmath20 is decomposed into a system of @xmath262 disjoint polyhedral subdomains @xmath263 , @xmath264 .    tfeti domain decomposition with subdomain renumbering , height=207 ] \\n we assume that the decomposition is consistent with the triangulation @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath265 and define @xmath266 after the decomposition each boundary @xmath267 of @xmath268 consists of three disjoint parts @xmath269 , @xmath270 , and @xmath271 , @xmath272 , where @xmath273 with @xmath274 being the part of @xmath267 which is glued to @xmath275 , @xmath276 .    similarly to the definition of @xmath126 \\n , we can define the spaces @xmath277 , @xmath278 , of piecewise linear and continuous approximations of @xmath279 : @xmath280 ^ 3\\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall t\\\\in \\\\mathcal t_h^p,\\\\;\\\\;v_h^p|_{\\\\gamma^p_u}=0\\\\}.\\\\ ] ] let @xmath281 be a product space and @xmath282 let us note that we slightly distinguish the notation introduced for the tfeti method from the notation introduced in sections [ section.elastoplastic ] and [ section.newton ] . for example , we write @xmath283 for the tfeti method while in section [ section.elastoplastic ] , we used the notation @xmath284 . \\n a similar distinction is also introduced for the below algebraic description of the tfeti method . \\n let @xmath285 be a functional defined on @xmath283 . \\n then the minimization problem ( [ min_form ] ) can be equivalently rewritten into the form : @xmath286 where @xmath287 and @xmath142 solves ( [ min_form ] ) . \\n each function @xmath288 , @xmath289 , can be represented by a vector @xmath290 , @xmath291 , where @xmath292 , is the algebraic representation of @xmath293 and @xmath294 . \\n similarly we can find the vector @xmath295 , @xmath296 , such that @xmath297 is the algebraic representation of the load restricted on @xmath268 and @xmath298 . \\n let the matrix @xmath299 represent the gluing conditions introduced in ( [ def_k_h ] ) and @xmath300 the dirichlet boundary conditions introduced in ( [ def_v_h_p ] ) . \\n both matrices can be combined into one constraint matrix @xmath301 , \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{b } \\\\in \\\\mathbb{r}^{{\\\\tt m}\\\\times { \\\\tt n}},\\\\quad { \\\\tt m } = { \\\\tt m}_g + { \\\\tt m}_u.\\\\ ] ] typically @xmath302 is much smaller than @xmath303 . \\n let us note that @xmath304 can be assembled to have different forms : redundant , non - redundant or orthonormal . \\n the rows of @xmath305 in the standard redundant form are vectors of the order @xmath303 with zero entries except 1 and -1 at appropriate positions . \\n the orthonormal form is obviously obtained from the redundant one by only special treating of the rows of @xmath304 corresponding to the nodes shared by more subdomains , i.e. , for each of such nodes we take all corresponding rows in the redundant form , othonormalize them , and remove dependent ones . \\n this can be done in parallel . for more details \\n see  @xcite . \\n in fact all forms are applicable but due to simplicity of our presentation we use the orthonormal form of @xmath304 .    let the matrix @xmath306 , @xmath307 denotes a symmetric positive semidefinite block diagonal matrix , where @xmath308 here @xmath309 is the algebraic representation of @xmath310 and @xmath311 is a restriction operator for a displacement vector @xmath312 to a local element @xmath313 . \\n the diagonal blocks @xmath314 , @xmath315 , which correspond to the subdomains @xmath268 , are positive semidefinite sparse matrices with known kernels , the rigid body modes . \\n the algebraical formulation of ( [ min_form2 ] ) is following : @xmath316    even though ( [ equ.3radky ] ) is a standard convex quadratic programming problem , its formulation is not suitable for numerical solution . \\n the reasons are that @xmath317 is typically ill - conditioned , singular , and very large .    the complications mentioned above may be essentially reduced by applying the duality theory of convex programming ( see , e.g. , dostl @xcite ) , where all the constraints are enforced by the lagrange multipliers @xmath318 . \\n the lagrangian associated with problem ( [ equ.3radky ] ) is @xmath319 it is well known @xcite that ( [ equ.3radky ] ) is equivalent to the saddle point problem : @xmath320 in sense that @xmath321 solves if and only if @xmath322 solves . \\n the solution of leads to the equivalent problem to find @xmath323 satisfying : @xmath324 the system is uniquely solvable which is guaranteed by the following necessary and sufficient conditions  @xcite : @xmath325 notice that is the condition on the full row - rank of @xmath304 . \\n let us mention that an orthonormal basis of @xmath326 is known a - priori and that its vectors are columns of @xmath327 , @xmath328 . \\n the first equation in is satisfied if @xmath329 and @xmath330 for an appropriate @xmath331 and arbitrary matrix @xmath332 satisfying @xmath333 . \\n here @xmath332 is a generalized inverse matrix whose application on a vector can be efficiently implemented ( see remark [ rem_pseudo ] ) . \\n [ rem_pseudo ] the diagonal block @xmath314 , @xmath315 , which corresponds to the subdomain @xmath268 , is positive semidefinite sparse matrix with known kernel basis created by the rigid body modes . \\n the first note about practical implementation of the action of the generalized inverse based on modified cholesky factorization can be found in @xcite . \\n this approach does not solve how to detect carefully zero pivots . \\n in contrast to @xcite we use the kernel basis and fixing nodes strategy to effectively regularize all blocks without extra fill in and then decompose them using any standard sparse cholesky type factorization method for nonsingular matrices @xcite . the action of @xmath332 on a vector is naturally parallelized with respect to the subdomains and computed using backward and forward substitutions . \\n [ rem_pseudo_standa ] notice that the pseudoinverse @xmath332 can also be applied on vectors which do not belong to @xmath334 . \\n therefore we can write @xmath335 in the other text . the random error corresponding with this partition \\n is neglicted with respect to the implementation of @xmath332 introduced in remark [ rem_pseudo ] . \\n the condition can be equivalently written as @xmath336 further substituting into the second equation in we arrive at @xmath337 summarizing and we find that the pair @xmath338 satisfies : @xmath339 where @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 , and @xmath343    since @xmath344 is of full row - rank as follow from , the inverse @xmath345 exists and @xmath346 is well defined and represents the orthogonal projector onto @xmath347 . applying @xmath348 on the first equation in and checking that @xmath349 we eliminate @xmath350 and obtain that @xmath351 satisfies : @xmath352 in practical computations , we further decompose @xmath353 into two orthogonal components @xmath354 and @xmath355 , substitute them in to and get the problem @xmath356 with @xmath357 , where @xmath358 is sparse and can be treated efficiently by parallel direct solvers such as mumps @xcite . \\n equation is solved efficiently by the projected conjugate gradient method with preconditioning ( pcgp ) . in numerical examples , \\n we consider both the computationally less expensive lumped preconditioner to @xmath359 in the form @xmath360 and the ( quasi- ) optimal dirichlet preconditioner in the form @xmath361 introduced in @xcite , where @xmath362 is the schur complement to the block of @xmath363 corresponding to the interior nodes and @xmath364 is the restriction of @xmath304 to the remaining nodes , i.e. , to the nodes with imposed dirichlet and gluing conditions . \\n the condition number estimates contain a linear factor of @xmath365 ( @xmath366 is the domain decomosition step and @xmath238 is the discretization step ) for the lumped preconditioner as opposed to a polylogarithmic bound for the dirichlet preconditioner . \\n more details about other forms of the dirichlet preconditioners and estimates of condition number can be found in @xcite . \\n we obtain the following algorithmic scheme for the solution of :    [ algorithm_tfeti ]    1.2    set @xmath341 , @xmath367 , @xmath342 , and @xmath343 . \\n compute @xmath368 . \\n set @xmath369 . \\n compute @xmath370 from

operations may be implemented in parallel . \\n parallelization of feti / tfeti is based on distributing matrix portions among processing units . \\n this allows algorithms to be almost the same in sequential and parallel versions ; only data structure implementation differs . \\n most of computations ( subdomain operations ) appearing are purely local and therefore parallelizable without any data transfers . \\n each of cores works with the local part associated with its subdomains . \\n natural effort using the massively parallel computers is to maximize the number of subdomains so that the sizes of the subdomain stiffness matrices are reduced . \\n this accelerates their factorization and subsequent pseudoinverse application which belongs to the most time consuming action . on the other hand , negative effect of \\n that is an increase of the null space dimension and the number of lagrange multipliers . \\n this leads to larger coarse problems , i.e. , applications of the projector @xmath348 which are scalable only up to a few thousands of cores and then the coarse problem solution starts to dominate . for the numerical solution of such large problems we recommend to use a hybrid feti method @xcite \\n the proposed algorithms were implemented in matsol library @xcite developed in matlab and parallelized using matlab distributed computing server and matlab parallel toolbox . for all computations we use maximum 28 cores with 2 gb memory per core of the hp blade system , model blc7000 . \\n the numbers of subdomains are chosen to keep the number of nodes per subdomain approximately constant except for the coarsest mesh level . \\n the performance is demonstrated on an elastoplastic homogeneous thin plate of sizes @xmath418 with the circular hole of radius 1 in the center . \\n its geometry with imposed boundary conditions and indicated symmetry planes is depicted in figure [ fig04 g ] . \\n thus we consider only eighth of the thin plate in our computations ( see figure [ fig04g2 ] ) and impose symmetry conditions on three symmetry surfaces . a similar benchmark was solved in @xcite . \\n the elastoplastic body @xmath20 is made of homegeneous isotropic material with the parameters @xmath419 where @xmath420 and @xmath421 are the young modulus and the poisson ratio , respectively , which are related with the lam coefficients @xmath422 and @xmath423 by the following formulas : @xmath424 the indicated traction forces with the history of loading taking into account are prescribed by the function @xmath425,\\\\ t_0=0,\\\\ t^*=\\\\frac{1}{4}.\\\\ ] ] since the elastoplastic model is rate - independent and any local unloading is not expected with respect to the prescribed load history , the results should be independent of the chosen time discretization . \\n let us consider two variants of the equidistant time discretization characterized by the time step @xmath426 :    * @xmath427 , @xmath428 , * @xmath429 , @xmath430 . \\n for the spatial discretization of @xmath20 , let us consider five levels of tetrahedral meshes generated by ansys with @xmath431 nodes decomposed into subdomains using metis . \\n an example of such decomposition is depicted in figure [ fig04d ] and a zoom near the hole in figure [ fig04d2 ] .            in table \\n [ tab : diferent_meshes ] , we report on numerical results for the time discretization @xmath432 , different mesh levels , the dirichlet and the lumped preconditioners . \\n the stopping tolerances of the newton and the pcgp algorithms are @xmath433 respectively . \\n we see that the number of the newton iterations remains almost constant for all meshes . \\n similar behavior was observed in the numerical results by @xcite . \\n note that even the total number of the pcgp iterations ( which means the sum of pcgp iterations over all newton steps ) increases only moderately for finer meshes and both preconditioners . \\n we observe similarly as in  @xcite that the dirichlet preconditioner is worse because of medium size of our problems , i.e. , the total number of pcgp iterations is less than for the lumped preconditioner but not sufficiently .    in table \\n [ tab : martin5_upr ] , the number of the pcgp iterations , the number of plastic elements , and the relative convergence criterion are reported for each newton s iteration of algorithm [ tfeti_elasto_plastic_algorithm ] . in this case , the time discretization @xmath432 , the finest mesh level , and the lumped preconditioner are considered together with sharper stopping tolerances @xmath434 so that more newton s iterations can be studied . \\n since the initial newton iteration is taken as zero vector ( of displacements ) , the first iteration of the newton method actually solves a purely elastic problem . \\n the second and further iterations already reflect an elastoplastic behaviour with stabilizing number of plastic elements and higher number of pcgp iterations . \\n this is caused by larger condition number of a considered matrix in accordance with estimate . \\n once plastic elements are identified in the 7th step , we observe the quadratic convergence of the newton method . \\n such behavior agrees with the theoretical results in @xcite .    in table \\n [ tab : time_steps ] , the computational history of algorithm [ tfeti_elasto_plastic_algorithm ] for the time discretization @xmath435 is documented . \\n we consider the finest mesh level , the stopping tolerances ( [ tolerances ] ) and the lumped preconditioner only . the corresponding development of the plastic zone is depicted for the times @xmath436 , @xmath437 , @xmath438 , and @xmath439 in figures [ fig11 ] - [ fig14 ] , respectively . \\n the growing zone of plastic elements results from the monotonically increased loading . \\n distributions of the von mises stress @xmath440 and the total displacement @xmath441 at the final time @xmath442 are depicted in figures [ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] , respectively . \\n mesh level & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 + number of mesh nodes & 520 & 1 623 & 9 947 & 166 374 & 309 546 + number of mesh elements & 1 441 & 6 279 & 48 287 & 931 709 & 1

@xmath432 and @xmath435 we see that the resulting number of plastic elements differs at the final time @xmath442 . the difference is less than @xmath443 and is caused by the roundoff errors , the use of iterative solvers , and the numerical evaluation of the yield function which decides whether an element plasticizes or not . \\n we have proposed the algorithm for the efficient parallel implementation of elastoplastic problems with the von mises plastic criterion and the linear isotropic hardening law which is based on the tfeti domain decomposition method . for the time discretization we used implicit euler method and for the space discretization of the respective one time step elastoplastic problem the finite element method . the latter results in a system of nonlinear equations with a strongly semismooth and strongly monotone operator . \\n thus the semismooth newton method was applied and respective linearized problems were solved in parallel using tfeti . \\n the performance of our algorithm was demonstrated on the 3d elastoplastic thin plate with the hole in the center and prescribed loading history . \\n numerical results for different time discretizations and mesh levels were presented and discussed . local quadratic convergence of the semismooth newton method was observed after identification of the plastic zone which is in accordance with the theoretical results . \\n our future plan is to apply the proposed tfeti based algorithm on elastoplastic multi - body contact problems of mechanics . \\n this has already been done

barrier junctions @xcite , granular systems @xcite , and others . \\n when the central part of a double - barrier junction is sufficiently small , the interplay of discrete charging by single electrons and spin dependence of tunnelling processes can lead to additional interesting features in the corresponding transport characteristics @xcite .    up to now , \\n most of theoretical works on transport through quantum dots ( qds ) coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes was limited to collinear , i.e. , parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations @xcite . \\n it is only very recently when transport in systems with non - collinear magnetizations was addressed @xcite . in particular \\n , it has been shown that the diode - like features in transport characteristics of systems with one electrode being half - metallic are significantly reduced when magnetic moments of the electrodes become non - collinear @xcite . \\n however , this behavior was studied only in the sequential tunneling regime .    in recent papers @xcite spin precession in electron tunnelling through an interacting quantum dot \\n was studied theoretically in the first order approximation with respect to the tunneling hamiltonian . \\n such a precession takes place when magnetic moments of the leads are non - collinear , and occurs because an electron entering the dot in a tunnelling event is subject to an effective exchange field , which exerts a torque on the electron spin and makes the spin precesses by a certain angle before the electron leaves the dot . in the first order approximation , \\n the spin precession is driven by the coulomb interaction on the dot ( described by the hubbard correlation parameter @xmath0 ) and disappears when @xmath0 tends to zero .    in this paper we extend the earlier descriptions @xcite of electron tunneling through qd with non - collinear magnetizations by going beyond the first order approximation . in order to calculate the tunneling current and spin precession \\n , we employ the non - equilibrium green function technique and limit considerations to the hartree - fock approximation . hence , besides the sequential tunneling also the contribution due to higher order tunneling processes is included in the description . \\n numerical results show , that spin precession also exist in the limit of @xmath1 . \\n however , coulomb correlations significantly enhance the precession . \\n this , in turn , may lead to negative differential conductance in a certain bias voltage range . \\n we predict that symmetry of the junction , barrier height , and spin polarization of magnetic leads may significantly influence spin dependent characteristics of the dot . in particular , it is shown that the diode - like behavior in asymmetrical junctions with one half - metallic electrode is partially suppressed in non - collinear configurations . \\n however , the suppression is much less evident than that obtained within a simplified theory neglecting the exchange interactions between the dot and leads @xcite . \\n the paper is organized as follows . in section \\n ii we describe model of the system . \\n theoretical method is described in section iii , where the equation of motion method is used to derive nonequilibrium green functions of the dot . \\n transport characteristics are calculated in section iv , whereas relevant numerical results on tunnelling current , magnetoresistance , and spin precession are presented and discussed in section v. finally , summary and general conclusions are in section vi . \\n we consider a single - level qd coupled to two ferromagnetic metallic leads by tunnelling barriers . \\n magnetic moments in the external leads lie in a common plane and form an arbitrary angle @xmath2 . to describe electron \\n spin we will use the local and global quantization axes . \\n the local axes are determined by the local spin polarization in the leads . the global quantization axis ( the axis @xmath3 in our case ) \\n is assumed to coincide with the local one in the left electrode . \\n spin projection on the local quantization axes will be denoted as @xmath4 for majority electrons and @xmath5 for minority electrons , whereas projection on the global quantization axis will be denoted as @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \\n axis @xmath8 of the coordinate system is normal to the plane @xmath9 determined by the spin polarizations of the leads . \\n geometry of the device and the orientation of the coordinate system are shown schematically in fig.1 . \\n schematics of the system considered in this paper . \\n the coordinate systems used to describe states of the dot is also shown . ] \\n the whole system can be described by hamiltonian of the general form @xmath10 the term @xmath11 describes the left ( @xmath12 ) and right ( @xmath13 ) electrodes in the non -

metallic ) external electrodes , @xmath118 , and with the dot level above the fermi level of the electrodes at equilibrium , @xmath119 . \\n bias dependence of electric current and the corresponding differential conductance are shown in fig.2(a ) and fig.2(b ) for selected values of the angle @xmath2 . \\n the current - voltage curve for parallel configuration ( @xmath120 ) reveals typical step - like characteristics . \\n below the first ( lower ) threshold voltage the dot is empty and thus sequential contribution to electric current is exponentially suppressed . the first step in \\n the current occurs at the bias , where the discrete level @xmath121 crosses the fermi level of the source electrode ( the dot can be occupied by a single electron ) , whereas the step at a higher voltage ( higher threshold ) corresponds to the case when @xmath122 crosses this fermi level ( the dot may be doubly occupied ) .    in non - collinear configurations a monotonous suppression of the tunneling current with increasing @xmath2 takes place in the whole bias voltage range , and the current disappears for @xmath123 . \\n this is a typical ( perfect ) spin - valve effect . \\n suppression of electric current is due to an electron residing on the dot , whose spin orientation prevents it from tunneling to the drain lead . in the extreme case of antiparallel configuration , @xmath124 , the electron that has tunneled to the dot from the fully polarized source electrode blocks transport through the junction since it can not tunnel further to the oppositely polarized drain lead . \\n this scenario holds as long as spin - flip relaxation processes are absent . \\n the steps in current - voltage characteristics give rise to the narrow peaks in differential conductance displayed in fig.2(b ) , which occur at the lower and higher threshold voltages . \\n apart from this , dependence of electric current on magnetic configuration of the system leads to the tmr effect , defined quantitatively by eq.(39 ) , and is shown in fig.2(c ) . \\n the effect increases with increasing angle @xmath2 and tends to infinity when @xmath125 ( therefore there is no curve in fig.2(c ) for @xmath126 ) . \\n bias dependence of electric current ( a ) , differential conductance ( b ) , and tunnel magnetoresistance ( c ) , calculated for indicated values of the angle @xmath2 . \\n the inset in ( a ) shows electric current between the lower and higher threshold voltages for @xmath127 . \\n the parameters assumed for numerical calculations are : @xmath128 ev , @xmath129 ev , @xmath130 ev , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 k. ]    bias dependence of the average spin components ; @xmath134 ( a ) , @xmath135 ( b ) and @xmath136 ( c ) for indicated values of the angle @xmath2 . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.2 . ] \\n an interesting feature of the current - voltage characteristics is the negative differential conductance , which may occur in non - collinear configurations between the lower and higher threshold voltages ( between the corresponding two peaks in the differential conductance ) . \\n the negative differential conductance corresponds to some enhancement in tmr , as can be seen in fig.2(c ) . \\n the enhancement is particularly significant for rather large values of the angle @xmath2 ( smaller that @xmath137 ) . \\n physical origin of this feature becomes clear , when taking into account bias dependence of the average spin on the dot in nonequilibrium situation ( spin accumulated on the dot ) . \\n bias dependence of the average spin component @xmath136 for @xmath127 and for indicated values of the coulomb correlation parameter @xmath0 ( a ) and the lead polarization ( b ) . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.2 . ]    as shown in fig.3(a ) , the absolute value of the average @xmath138 increases with increasing @xmath2 and almost vanishes in the parallel configuration . in turn \\n , the average value of the @xmath139-component , @xmath135 , vanishes for both parallel and antiparallel alignments and is nonzero for canted configurations , as shown in fig.3(b ) . \\n similarly , the average value of @xmath136 also vanishes in the collinear configurations and is nonzero in the noncollinear ones . \\n one should point here , that neither initial spin state in the source electrode , nor the final state in the drain electrode have nonvanishing @xmath8-component ( perpendicular to the plane determined by spin polarizations of the two leads ) . \\n what is then the reason of nonvanishing @xmath136 ? \\n this can be accounted for by taking into account the fact , that an electron residing on the dot experiences a certain exchange field resulting from coupling between the dot and leads , which effectively acts as a local magnetic field @xcite . strength of this molecular field and its orientation with respect to the global quantization axis depend on the applied bias voltage and on the angle between the magnetic moments of the leads . \\n thus , if an electron that has tunneled from the source lead resides sufficiently long time on the dot level , its spin experiences a torque due to the exchange interaction , which results in precession of the average spin around the molecular field , and consequently in a nonzero average value of the transverse component @xmath136 . as shown in fig.3(c ) , this precession - induced component is significant in non - collinear cases ( see the case of @xmath127 ) and in the voltage range between the two threshold voltages . \\n just this enhanced precession is associated with a decrease in electric current , which leads to negative differential conductance .    as follows from the above discussion \\n , the magnitude of @xmath140 is a measure of the spin precession induced by the effective exchange field . in fig.4(a ) we show @xmath136 for different values of the coulomb correlation parameter @xmath0 . \\n the curve for @xmath1 indicates that spin precession in noncollinear configurations takes place also when there is no coulomb interaction between electrons on the dot . \\n however , as follows from fig.4(a ) , the presence of such an interaction enhances the spin precession and also extends the voltage range where the precession is significant . \\n bias dependence of the tunnel magnetoresistance in symmetrical junctions for indicated values of the lead polarization . \\n the curves are plotted for the non - collinear configuration , @xmath127 . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.2 . ]    bias dependence of electric current ( a ) , and the average value of the @xmath8 component of the dot spin ( b ) , calculated for indicated values of the angle @xmath2 and @xmath141 ev . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.2 . ] \\n the spin precession also depends on the spin polarization of external electrodes . \\n this is shown in fig.4(b ) , where the @xmath8-component of the average spin accumulated on the dot is shown for several values of the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 . \\n this figure clearly shows that the spin precession decreases when spin polarization of the leads becomes smaller . \\n this is reasonable since lower spin polarization creates smaller exchange field . \\n when the spin polarization rate of the leads becomes smaller than 1 , electric current can flow also in the antiparallel configuration , contrary to the case shown in fig.2 for @xmath131 . \\n consequently , the tmr effect also becomes smaller and remains finite for @xmath126 . in fig.5 \\n we show the tmr effect for different polarizations of the external electrodes , and for a particular noncollinear configuration ( @xmath127 ) . \\n the curves are symmetrical with respect to the bias reversal . \\n the central peak corresponds to an enhanced magnetoresistance in the current blockade regime . \\n such an enhancement of tmr in the blockade regime , where sequential tunneling is suppressed , was also observed earlier for collinear configurations @xcite . \\n although the sequential current is exponentially suppressed in the blockade regime , the electrons still can flow due to higher order processes ( like cotunneling ) . \\n the other two broad maxima placed symmetrically on both sides of the central peak , occur between the two ( lower and higher ) threshold voltages . \\n the following features of these two maxima are interesting to note . \\n first , for small values of the polarization parameters , the central maximum is larger than the others . \\n the situation changes with increasing polarization factors , and now the central peak becomes smaller for high spin polarizations of the leads . \\n second , the two maxima become strongly asymmetric for large values of the spin polarization factors , as clearly visible in fig.5 . to account for \\n this behavior one should take into account bias dependence of @xmath136 from fig.4(b ) , which shows clearly the corelations between the spin precession and height and shape of the tmr peaks with increasing polarization . \\n in the situation studied above the dot level was empty at equilibrium . \\n qualitatively similar behavior of electric current , magnetoresistance , and average spin on the dot , has been found for the situation when the dot level is below the fermi level , and the dot is occupied by a single electron at equilibrium . \\n exemplary current - voltage characteristics are shown in fig.6(a ) , and the corresponding @xmath8-components of the average spin on the dot are    bias dependence of electric current ( a ) and magnetoresistance ( b ) , calculated for indicated values of the angle @xmath2 . \\n the inset in ( a ) shows current between the threshold voltages for negative bias . \\n the parameters assumed for numerical calculations are : @xmath128 ev , @xmath129 ev , @xmath130 ev , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath133 k. ]    angular variation of electric current ( a ) and tmr ( b ) for indicated values of the bias voltage . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.7 . ] \\n bias dependence of the average spin components ; @xmath134 ( a ) , @xmath135 ( b ) and @xmath136 ( c ) for indicated values of the angle @xmath2 . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.6 . ]    bias dependence of electric current ( a ) , and the average value of the @xmath8 component of the dot spin ( b ) , calculated for indicated values of the angle @xmath2 and @xmath141 ev . \\n the other parameters are as in fig.7 . ]    shown in fig.6(b ) . \\n the current - voltage curves display similar features as the curves shown in fig.2(a ) , with characteristic negative differential conductance between the threshold voltages for noncollinear configurations . \\n the main difference in the bias dependence of @xmath136 is a reversed sign of the peaks at the lower threshold voltage in comparison to that in fig.3(c ) . \\n now the dot is separated from both electrodes by non - equivalent barriers , @xmath147 , and the electrodes are made of different ferromagnetic materials , @xmath148 . for numerical calculations \\n we assume @xmath76=0.4 , @xmath149=1 , and @xmath146 . \\n more specifically , it is assumed that the right electrode is made of a half - metallic material with electrons being totally spin - polarized at the fermi level , whereas the factor @xmath146 indicates that on average electrons can tunnel much easier to ( from ) the left electrode than to ( from ) the right one . \\n this asymmetry between the left and right electrodes and barriers gives rise to asymmetrical transport characteristics of the junction with respect to the bias reversal . \\n the asymmetry is clearly visible in current - voltage characteristics and bias dependence of tmr , shown in fig.7(a ) and fig.7(b ) , respectively . for positive bias ( the right lead is the source electrode ) , \\n the current and tmr curves are rather uniform above the first threshold voltage . \\n the current flows there for arbitrary value of the angle @xmath2 and thus tmr is significantly suppressed . \\n the situation changes diametrically when the electric current flows in the opposite direction , i.e. when electrons tunnel through the dot from the left electrode to the right ( half - metallic ) one . \\n below the first threshold voltage sequential tunneling is exponentially suppressed and only the higher - order tunneling processes are possible . \\n when the energy level @xmath121 enters the tunneling window , electric current starts to flow through the junction but this takes place only in a small voltage range in the vicinity of the first threshold voltage , where the characteristic resonant bump is observed . above the bump , the current is suppressed by an electron residing on the dot . \\n when @xmath122 crosses the fermi level of the source lead , the current increases again and finally saturates at a certain level . for positive bias , @xmath150 , the curves in fig.7(a ) and fig.7(b ) for different values of the angle \\n @xmath2 reflect a monotonous angular variation of the current and tmr , shown also explicitly in fig.8 for a particular value of the bias voltage . for negative bias one \\n observes a more complex and interesting behavior of the transport characteristics . \\n first , the above mentioned suppression of electric current between the two steps is now less pronounced , and the corresponding angular variation of electric current and tmr is non - monotonous , as shown explicitly in fig.8 by the relevant curve . \\n when the negative bias voltage surpasses the second threshold , the monotonous variation of electric current and tmr is restored . \\n it is also interesting to note , that the tmr effect is enhanced in the voltage regions , where electric current is suppressed . \\n this is the region below the first threshold voltage , and for negative bias also the region between the two threshold voltages . \\n the latter one is particularly interesting as the tmr may change there sign from positive to negative ( see fig.7(b ) and fig.8(b ) ) . \\n suppression of electric current by an electron of a given spin orientation localized on the dot can be accounted for by analyzing spin accumulated on the dot when a steady state current flows through the system . \\n this is illustrated in fig.9(a - c ) , where the part ( c ) shows the component induced by spin precession . \\n the spin precession is particularly enhanced for negative bias between the two thresholds - exactly where electric current is suppressed . \\n the enhancement is a consequence of relatively long time that electrons spend on the dot . \\n the situation is different for the dot level lying under the fermi level , i.e. , when the dot is already occupied by one electron in equilibrium situation . \\n the corresponding numerical results are shown in fig.10 , where part ( a ) shows the current - voltage characteristics , and part ( b ) the average value of the perpendicular @xmath8-component of the average spin accumulated on the dot . \\n the transport characteristics for collinear configurations were already accounted for in earlier publications @xcite , and their most interesting feature is the pronounced asymmetry with respect to the bias reversal ( diode - like behavior ) . for noncollinear configurations transport characteristics \\n have new features , which are qualitatively similar to those found in the case of empty dot at equilibrium , like for instance nonmonotonous angular variation of electric current and tmr . \\n using the non - equilibrium green function approach we have calculated electric current , average value of electron spin accumulated on the dot , and tunnel magnetoresistance due to rotation of the magnetic moments of external electrodes . \\n it has been shown that the average spin precesses by a certain angle around an effective exchange field arising from the interaction between the dot and electrodes . \\n this precession leads to a nonzero value of @xmath136 , i.e. , of the component normal to the plane determined by magnetic moments of both electrodes . \\n it has been also shown that the spin precession is enhanced by coulomb correlations and strong spin polarization of the leads . \\n the spin precession is shown to exist also in the limit of vanishing coulomb correlations on the dot . \\n moreover , the interplay of coulomb correlations and effective exchange field may lead to a negative differential conductance in the voltage range between the two threshold voltages . \\n it has been also shown , that the diode -

The first publication is \"A Discrete Geometric Approach for Simulating the Dynamics of Thin Viscous Threads\" in the Journal', \"quasi one - dimensional objects are characterized by having one dimension , the length @xmath0 , much larger than the others , say the radius @xmath1 , so that @xmath2 . \\n relative to three - dimensional objects , this measure of slenderness allows for enormous mathematical simplification in accurately describing the physical dynamics of strings , filaments and rods . \\n it is thus perhaps not surprising that the physics of strings have been the subject of intense study for centuries @xcite , and indeed their investigation substantially pre - dates the birth of three - dimensional elasticity .    following the pioneering work of galileo on the bending of cantilevers , one - dimensional analytical models of beams date back to 1761 when jakob bernoulli first introduced the use of differential equations to capture the relation between geometry and bending resistance in a _ \\n planar elastica _ \\n , that is an elastic curve deforming in a two - dimensional space . \\n this attempt was then progressively refined by huygens , leibniz and johann bernoulli @xcite , until euler presented a full solution of the planar elastica , obtained by minimizing the strain energy and by recognizing the relation between flexural stiffness and material and geometric properties . \\n euler also showed the existence of bifurcating solutions in a rod subject to compression , identifying its first buckling mode , while lagrange formalized the corresponding multi - modal solution @xcite . \\n non - planar deformations of the elastica were first tackled by kirchhoff @xcite and clebsch @xcite who envisioned a rod as an assembly of short undeformable straight segments with dynamics determined by contact forces and moments , leading to three - dimensional configurations . \\n later , love @xcite approached the problem from a lagrangian perspective characterizing a filament by contiguous cross sections that can rotate relative to each other , but remain undeformed and perpendicular to the centerline of the rod at all times ; in modern parlance this assumption is associated with dynamics on the rotation group so(3 ) at every cross - section . \\n the corresponding equations of motion capture the ability of the filament to bend and twist , but not shear or stretch . \\n eventually the cosserat brothers @xcite relaxed the assumption of inextensibility and cross - section orthogonality to the centerline , deriving a general mathematical framework that accommodates all six possible degrees of freedom associated with bending , shearing , twisting and stretching , effectively formulating dynamics on the full euclidean group se(3 ) . \\n the availability of these strong mathematical foundations @xcite prompted a number of discrete computational models @xcite that allow for the exploration of a range of physical phenomena . \\n these include , for example , the study of polymers and dna @xcite , elastic and viscous threads @xcite , botanical applications @xcite , elastic ribbons @xcite , woven cloth @xcite and tangled hair @xcite . because the scaled ratio of the stretching and shearing stiffness to the bending stiffness for slender filaments is @xmath3 , the assumption of inextensibility and unshearability is usually appropriate , justifying the widespread use of the kirchhoff model in the aforementioned applications .    however , new technologies such as soft robotics and artificial muscles are generating applications for highly deformable elastomeric filamentous structures @xcite for which the assumption of inextensibility and unshearability is no longer valid . \\n motivated by these advancements , we move away from the kirchhoff model in favor of the complete cosserat theory . \\n we present a numerical scheme that tracks both the rod centerline and local frame allowing for bending , twist , shear and stretch @xcite consistent with the full euclidean group se(3 ) , while retaining the hamiltonian structure of the system and fast discrete operators . \\n this allows us to substantially increase the spectrum of problems amenable to be treated via this class of rod models . \\n moving beyond the passive mechanics of single filaments , we also account for the interaction between filaments and complex environments with a number of additional biological and physical features , including muscular activity , self - contact and contact with solid boundaries , isotropic and anisotropic surface friction and viscous interaction with a fluid . \\n finally , we demonstrate how our method can be embedded in an inverse optimization design cycle to characterize terrestrial and aquatic limbless locomotion . \\n the paper is structured as follows . in section \\n [ sec : govequations ] we review and introduce the mathematical foundations of the model . in section \\n [ sec : discretization ] we present the corresponding discrete scheme . in section [ sec : additionalphysics ] we detail the physical and biological enhancements to the original model . in section [ sec : validation ] \\n we validate our framework against a battery of benchmark problems . in section \\n [ sec : applications ] we showcase the potential of our solver via the study of solenoids and plectonemes as well as limbless biolocomotion . \\n all symbols employed throughout this work , additional validation test cases and mathematical derivations are summarized in the appendix . \\n we consider filaments as slender cylindrical structures deforming in three - dimensions with a characteristic length @xmath0 which is assumed to be much larger than the radius ( @xmath4 ) at any cross section . \\n then the filament can be geometrically reduced to a one - dimensional representation , and its dynamical behavior may be approximated by averaging all balance laws at every cross section . \\n this approach is formalized in the cosserat rod theory @xcite . \\n and couples @xmath5 line densities.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : cosserat ] , a filament in the cosserat rod theory can be described by a centerline @xmath6\\\\in \\\\mathbb{r},t\\\\in \\\\mathbb{r}^+)\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{r}^3 $ ] and an oriented frame of reference @xmath7\\\\in \\\\mathbb{r},t\\\\in \\\\mathbb{r}^+)\\\\rightarrow\\\\text{so}(3)$ ] equivalent to the orthonormal triad of unit vectors @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the centerline arc - length coordinate in its current configuration and @xmath10 is time . \\n we introduce the notation @xmath11 to denote any generic vector represented in the eulerian frame and @xmath12 as the body - convected ( lagrangian ) frame of reference @xmath13 where eq . \\n ( [ eq : eulerianrep ] ) expresses @xmath11 in the laboratory canonical basis @xmath14 , while eq . \\n ( [ eq : lagrangianrep ] ) expresses it in the director basis @xmath15 . \\n then , the matrix @xmath16 transforms any vector @xmath11 from the laboratory to the body - convected representation via @xmath17 and conversely , @xmath18 , since @xmath19 . \\n the time and space derivatives of the centerline @xmath20 are associated with the velocity @xmath21 and tangent field @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 , since @xmath9 is the current arc - length . \\n similarly , time and space derivatives of the material frame @xmath16 , due to the orthonormality of the directors , are associated by definition with the angular velocity @xmath25 and generalized curvature @xmath26 vectors , so that @xmath27 @xmath28 where the equivalences @xmath29 and @xmath30 hold . \\n these kinematic equations combined with the linear and angular momentum balance laws at a cross section @xcite , yield the governing equations for the cosserat rod @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the constant material density , @xmath33 is the cross sectional area in its current state ( so that @xmath34 is the linear momentum line density ) , @xmath35 is the angular momentum line density , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the internal force and torque resultants , and @xmath38 and @xmath5 are external body force and torque line densities that can be used to accommodate a range of biophysical phenomena , from self - contact and muscular activation , to surface friction and hydrodynamics . \\n the internal force @xmath39 and torque @xmath40 resultants depend on the geometric and material properties of the filament . \\n this dependence is embedded via the material or constitutive laws , which must be frame invariant , rendering their definition in a lagrangian setting most natural . \\n moreover , we note that the angular momentum line density can be readily expressed in the material frame as @xmath41 , where the tensor @xmath42 is the second area moment of inertia which , assuming circular cross sections , takes the form @xmath43    therefore , we rewrite eqs . \\n ( [ eq : vel]-[eq : angmoment ] ) in a more convenient mixed eulerian - lagrangian form , suitable to be tackled numerically . from the definition of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : transport1 ] , [ eq : transport2 ] ) , we can derive ( see appendix ) the identity @xmath44 so that the system of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : vel]-[eq : angmoment ] ) may be expressed ( see appendix ) as @xmath45    this system of equations is now closer to the form we wish to numerically integrate , although the internal force @xmath46 and couple @xmath47 resultants are yet to be defined . because the arc - length coordinate @xmath9 corresponds to the current filament configuration , it may not coincide with the arc - length coordinate @xmath48 associated with the rest reference configuration of the filament ( fig . \\n [ fig : cosserat ] - throughout the rest of this work the hat will denote quantities with respect to the reference rest configuration ) . as a consequence , \\n all geometric quantities ( a , @xmath42 , @xmath49 , etc . ) \\n must be rescaled appropriately , as addressed in the following sections .      in order to close the system of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : vel2]-[eq : angmoment2 ] ) and determine the kinematics of the rod , it is necessary to specify the form of the internal forces and torques generated in response to bending , twist , shear and axial strains . since we wish to account for all six deformation modes , six degrees of freedom are associated with each cross section along the rod and therefore six constitutive laws must be specified . \\n the strains are the relative local deformations of the rod with respect to its rest reference configuration . bending and twist strains \\n are associated with the derivative in space of the material frame directors @xmath15 and are characterized by the generalized curvature ( eq .  [ eq : transport2 ] ) . \\n specifically , the components of the curvature projected along the directors ( @xmath50 ) coincides with bending ( @xmath51 ) and twist ( @xmath52 ) strains in the material frame ( table  [ tab : strains ] ) . \\n we wish to reiterate here that the constitutive laws are most simply expressed in a lagrangian form , due to translational and rotational invariance , hence the use of @xmath49 and not @xmath26 . \\n shear and axial strains are associated with the derivative in space of the centerline coordinate @xmath53 and are characterized by the vector @xmath54 ( fig . \\n [ fig : cosserat ] ) which , in the material frame of reference , takes the form @xmath55 and is a consequence of the non - orthogonality of the cross sections with respect to the centerline . here \\n , the scalar field @xmath56 expresses the local stretching or compression ratio ( fig . \\n [ fig : cosserat ] ) relative to the rest reference configuration ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath22 is the unit tangent vector , independent from the choice of arc - length @xmath9 or @xmath48 . \\n if no axial extension or compression occurs , the arc - length @xmath9 coincides with @xmath48 at all times and therefore the dilatation factor becomes the constant @xmath57 . \\n morevoer , if @xmath58 then @xmath57 and @xmath59 so that we recover the algebraic kirchhoff constraint for unshearable and inextensible rods @xcite . \\n together , these provide the intuition for relating @xmath60 to shear ( @xmath61 ) and axial ( @xmath62 ) strains ( table  [ tab : strains ] ) . \\n l | k | e | l *

stretching , shear and twist specified in table  [ tab : strains ] . \\n the rigidities can be expressed as the product of a material component , represented by the young s ( @xmath82 ) and shear ( @xmath83 ) moduli , and a geometric component represented by @xmath33 , @xmath42 and the constant @xmath84 for circular cross sections @xcite . \\n then the resultant _ load - strain _ relations of table  [ tab : strains ] can be generically expressed in vectorial notation as @xmath85 where @xmath86(@xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) is the bending / twist stiffness matrix with @xmath87 the flexural rigidity about @xmath63 , @xmath88 the flexural rigidity about @xmath67 , @xmath89 the twist rigidity about @xmath71 , and @xmath90(@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) is the shear / stretch stiffness matrix with @xmath91 the shearing rigidity along @xmath63 , @xmath92 the shearing rigidity along @xmath67 , and @xmath93 the axial rigidity along @xmath71 . the vectors @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the intrinsic curvatures , twist , shears and stretch , and must be accounted for in the case of stress - free complex shapes . for simplicity , from now on \\n we assume that the filament is naturally straight in its stress - free state , so that @xmath96 . \\n we note that the rigidity matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 are assumed to be diagonal throughout this study , although off diagonal entries can be easily accommodated to model anisotropic materials such as composite elements . in general , this mathematical formulation can be readily extended to tackle a richer set of physical problems including viscous threads @xcite , magnetic filaments @xcite , etc . \\n , by simply modifying the entries of @xmath97 and @xmath98 and introducing time dependent constitutive laws wherein @xmath99 and @xmath100 . \\n whenever the filament undergoes axial stretching or compression the corresponding infinitesimal elements deform and all related geometric quantities are affected . by assuming that the material is incompressible and that the cross sections retain their circular shapes at all times , we can conveniently express governing equations and energies with respect to the rest reference configuration of the filament ( denoted by the hat ) in terms of the local dilatation @xmath101 . \\n then , the following relations hold @xmath102    multiplying both sides of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : linmoment2],[eq : angmoment2 ] ) by @xmath103 and substituting the identities of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : scaledquantities ] ) into eqs . \\n ( [ eq : vel2]-[eq : angmoment2 ] ) , yields the final system @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the infinitesimal mass element , and @xmath106 is the infinitesimal mass second moment of inertia . \\n we note that the left hand side and the unsteady dilatation term of eq . \\n ( [ eq : angmomentfinal ] ) arise from the expansion of the original rescaled angular momentum @xmath107 via chain rule . \\n we also note that the external force and couple are defined as @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( with @xmath38 and @xmath110 the force and torque line densities , respectively ) so as to account for the dependency on @xmath111 . \\n the external loads @xmath112 and @xmath113 allows us to accommodate additional physical effects , such as dissipation , muscular activity , surface friction , self - contact and hydrodynamics .    combined with some initial and boundary conditions , eqs . \\n ( [ eq : velfinal]-[eq : angmomentfinal ] ) express the dynamics and kinematics of the cosserat rod with respect to its initial rest configuration , in a form suitable to be readily discretized as described in section  [ sec : discretization ] .      in the simplest setting , \\n linear constitutive relations are consistent with energies being quadratic relative to a given natural or rest reference state . by accounting for the local dilatation through eqs . \\n ( [ eq : scaledquantities ] ) , the shear and stretch energy @xmath114 and the bending and twist energy @xmath115 may therefore be written as @xmath116 while translational @xmath117 and rotational @xmath118 energies may be expressed as @xmath119    we note that the governing eqs . \\n ( [ eq : vel2]-[eq : angmoment2 ] ) that follow from the kinematic eqs . \\n ( [ eq : velocities][eq : transport1 ] ) and force and torque balances @xcite , can be equivalently obtained from the energy functionals via unconstrained variational derivatives with respect to the strains @xcite . \\n to derive the numerical method for the time evolution of a filament in analogy with the continuum model of section [ sec : govequations ] , we first recall a few useful definitions for effectively implementing rotations . we then present the spatial discrete model of the rod , and the time discretization approach employed to evolve the governing equations . \\n it is important to notice that the rotation axis @xmath122 is expressed in the material frame of reference associated with the matrix @xmath120 ( or @xmath16 ) . with these tools in hand \\n , we now proceed to outline our numerical procedure . \\n inspired by previous studies of unshearable and inextensible rods @xcite , we capture the deformation of a filament in three - dimensional space via the time evolution of a discrete set of vertices @xmath130 $ ] and a discrete set of material frames @xmath131 $ ] , as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : dicretizedmodel ] . \\n each vertex is associated with the following discrete quantities @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the velocity , @xmath134 is a pointwise concentrated mass , and @xmath135 is the external force given in eq . \\n ( [ eq : linmomentfinal ] ) . \\n each material frame is associated with an edge @xmath136 connecting two consecutive vertices , and with the related discrete quantities @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 are the edge current length , reference length and dilatation factor , @xmath141 is the discrete tangent vector , @xmath142 is the discrete shear / axial strain vector , @xmath143 is the discrete angular velocity , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 are the edge reference cross - section area , mass second moment of inertia , bending / twist matrix and shear / stretch matrix , and finally @xmath148 is the external couple given in eq . \\n ( [ eq : angmoment ] ) .    while in the continuum setting of section [ sec : govequations ] all quantities are defined pointwise , in a discrete setting some of them , and in particular @xmath49 \\n , are naturally expressed in an integrated form over the domain @xmath149 along the filament @xcite . any integrated quantity divided by the corresponding integration domain length \\n @xmath150 is equivalent to its pointwise average . in the context of our discretization \\n the domain @xmath149 becomes the voronoi region @xmath151 of length @xmath152 which is defined only for the _ interior _ vertices @xmath153 . \\n each interior vertex is then also associated with the following discrete quantities @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the voronoi domain length at rest and @xmath156 is voronoi region dilatation factor . \\n we recall that the generalized curvature expresses a rotation per unit length about its axis , so that the quantity @xmath157 naturally expresses the rotation that transforms a material frame @xmath158 to its neighbour @xmath159 over the segment size @xmath155 along the rod . \\n therefore , the relation @xmath160 holds , so that @xmath161 . \\n finally , we introduce the bending / twist stiffness matrix @xmath162 consistent with the voronoi representation .    then , we may discretize the governing eqs . \\n ( [ eq : velfinal]-[eq : angmomentfinal ] ) so that they read @xmath163\\\\label{eq :

slip scenario ( @xmath252 ) , \\n the linear momentum balance in the direction @xmath234 , and the angular momentum balance about the axis @xmath235 express a kinematic constraint between the linear acceleration @xmath253 and angular acceleration @xmath254 , so that @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 are the forces and torques acting on the local element , and @xmath258 is the rolling friction force at the substrate - filament interface necessary to meet the no - slip condition . by recalling that a disk mass second moment of inertia about @xmath235 \\n is @xmath259 , the above system can be solved for the unknown @xmath260 and @xmath261 , yielding @xmath262    therefore the lateral friction force @xmath263 and the associate torque @xmath264 can be finally expressed as @xmath265 where @xmath266 and @xmath267 are , respectively , the rolling static and kinetic friction coefficients .      in the previous section we considered isotropic friction by assuming that the coefficients @xmath230 and @xmath229 are constant and independent from the direction of the total acting forces ( static case ) or relative velocities ( kinetic case ) . \\n nevertheless , frictional forces may be highly anisotropic . \\n for example , the anisotropy caused by the presence of scales on the body of a snake crucially affects gaits and performance @xcite . \\n the amonton -

time resolutions . \\n the straight rod originally at rest is twisted and compressed at a constant rate during the period @xmath315 . \\n subsequently , the ends of the rod are held in their final configurations for the period @xmath316 to allow the internal energy to dissipate ( according to the model of section  [ sec : dissipation ] ) until the steady state is reached . \\n simulations are carried out progressively refining the spatial discretization @xmath317 by varying @xmath318 and the time discretization @xmath319 is kept proportional to @xmath320 , as reported in fig . \\n [ fig : helicalbuckling_spaceconv ] .    as can be seen in fig . \\n ( [ fig : helicalbuckling_spaceconv])b , c , e the numerical solutions converge to the analytical one with second order in time and space , consistent with our spatial and temporal discretization schemes . \\n moreover , to further validate the energy conserving properties of the solver , we turn off the internal dissipation ( fig . \\n [ fig : helicalbuckling_spaceconv]d ) and observe that the total energy of the filament @xmath321 is constant after @xmath315 and matches its theoretical value @xmath322 . \\n so far we have considered benchmark problems entailing various combinations of bending and twisting modes . \\n we now proceed to validate our discrete model in the presence of stretching and shear . \\n we consider a system in which a rod hanging from one end and subject to gravity @xmath323 oscillates due to a mass @xmath324 suspended at the other end , and due to its own mass @xmath325 , as depicted in fig . \\n [ fig : oscillationgravity]a , d . \\n this system is analogous to a mass - spring oscillator . \\n the static solution is then obtained by integrating the infinitesimal elongations along the spring due to the local load @xcite , yielding the total equilibrium extension @xmath326 where @xmath327 is the spring constant , @xmath328 is a constant factor , and @xmath329 is the equivalent mass . \\n thus , the final equilibrium length of the rod reads @xmath330 , with @xmath331 being the rest unstretched length . \\n the dynamic solution is instead characterized by oscillations of period @xmath332 and by a time varying length @xmath333 of the spring @xmath334\\\\delta l^*.\\\\ ] ] in this case , unlike the static solution , the factor @xmath335 depends on the ratio @xmath336 . \\n in fact it can be shown @xcite that @xmath337 for @xmath338 , and @xmath339 for @xmath340 . \\n the obtained analytical results rely on the assumption of @xmath327 being constant in space and time , given a fixed ratio @xmath336 . \\n however , this condition is not met here since @xmath341 is a function of space and time , due to dilatation and mass conservation . \\n nevertheless , as the young s modulus @xmath342 , that is as a soft filament becomes stiff , the constant @xmath343 and our rod model must recover the behavior of the mass - spring oscillator . \\n indeed , fig . \\n [ fig : oscillationgravity]b , c , e , f shows how the proposed numerical method converges to the analytical oscillation period @xmath332 and normalized longitudinal displacement @xmath344 as @xmath82 increases . \\n next we examine the problem of twisting waves generated in a rod axially stretched , as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : longwaveload_conv]a . \\n the coupling between stretching and the other dynamic modes tests the rescaling in terms of the dilatation factor @xmath111 of eqs . \\n ( [ eq : linmomentfinal ] , [ eq : angmomentfinal ] ) . \\n the rod is clamped at one end , stretched by the quantity @xmath345 , and forced to angularly vibrate about the axial direction by applying at the free end the couple @xmath346 , where @xmath347 and @xmath348 are the corresponding forcing amplitude and frequency . in the case of no internal dissipation and constant circular sections , \\n the induced standing angular wave @xmath349 can be determined analytically . \\n the dynamics of twisting yields the wave equation for the angular displacement @xcite @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the shear wave velocity , @xmath83 is the shear modulus , and @xmath32 is the density . by assuming a solution of the form @xmath352 , and by applying the boundary conditions @xmath353 and @xmath354 with @xmath355 twisting torque and @xmath356 second area moment of inertia about the axial direction \\n , we can solve eq . \\n ( [ eq : twistwave ] ) obtaining @xmath357    as can be seen in fig . \\n [ fig : longwaveload_conv]b , our numerical method recovers the derived analytical solution for the twist angular displacement along the stretched rod . moreover \\n , the solver consistently exhibits a second order convergence in time and space given the error metric @xmath358 , where @xmath359 represents our numerical solutions in the limit of refinement ( fig . \\n [ fig : longwaveload_conv]c ) . \\n we consider now the effect of bending and shear simultaneously by validating our numerical methods against the timoshenko cantilever of fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]a . \\n timoshenko s model accounts for bending elasticity , rotary inertia and shear deformations , building on classical beam theories by rayleigh ( bending elasticity and rotary inertia ) and euler - bernoulli ( bending elasticity only ) . \\n the model captures the behavior of short or composite beams in which shear deformations effectively lower the stiffness of the rod @xcite . \\n we consider a beam clamped at one end @xmath360 and subject to the downward force @xmath277 at the free end @xmath361 , as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]a . \\n the static solution for the displacement @xmath362 along the vertical direction @xmath363 of the rod can then be analytically expressed as @xmath364 where as usual @xmath331 is the length of the rod , @xmath365 is the constant cross sectional area , @xmath366 is the area second moment of inertia about the axis @xmath367 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the young s and shear moduli , and @xmath84 is the timoshenko shear factor for circular sections and accounts for the fact that the shear stress varies over the section @xcite . furthermore , the timoshenko ( as well as rayleigh and euler - bernoulli ) theory relies on the assumption of small deflections , so that the horizontal coordinate @xmath368 along the direction @xmath293 can be approximated by the arc - length @xmath48 ( fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]a and _ appendix _ for further details and derivation ) , hence the use of @xmath48 in the above equation . \\n if the shear modulus @xmath83 approaches infinity or if the ratio @xmath369 , then the timoshenko model in the static case reduces to the euler - bernoulli approximation , yielding @xmath370 where the shear term of eq . \\n ( [ eq : displacementtimo ] ) becomes negligible . \\n we compare our numerical model with these results by carrying out simulations of the cantilever beam of fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]a in the time - space limit of refinement . as can be noticed in fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]b the discrete solution recovers the timoshenko one . \\n therefore , the solver correctly captures the role of shear that reduces the effective stiffness relative to the euler - bernoulli solution . \\n moreover , our approach is shown to converge to the analytical solution in all the norms @xmath371 , @xmath311 , @xmath312 of the error @xmath372 , where @xmath373 is the vertical displacement numerically obtained in the refinement limit . \\n we note that the norms @xmath371 and @xmath311 exhibit first order convergence , while @xmath312 decays with a slope between first and second order . \\n we attribute these results to the fact that while the timoshenko solution does not consider axial extension or tension , it does relies on the assumption of small deflections ( @xmath374 ) , therefore effectively producing a dilatation of the rod . on the contrary , our solver does not assume small deflections and does not neglect axial extension , since the third entry of the matrix @xmath97 has the finite value @xmath375 ( see fig .  [ \\n fig : timoshenko_conv ] for details ) . \\n this discrepancy is here empirically observed to decrease the convergence order . \\n this completes our validation of the proposed numerical scheme and demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of our methodology in simulating soft filaments in simple situations . \\n we now proceed to illustrate the potential of our framework by means of three different applications . \\n we consider first a static problem in which self - contact , bending and twist give rise to the classic out - of - plane configurations denoted as plectonemes @xcite , while the addition of stretching and shearing produces a different type of experimentally observed solutions , known as solenoids @xcite . \\n then we turn our attention to two dynamic biophysical problems in which an active filament interacts with a solid and a liquid environment , exhibiting qualitatively different optimal biolocomotion strategies . \\n when an inextensible rod is clamped at one end and twisted a sufficiently large number of times at the other end , it becomes unstable , coils up and generates a characteristic structure known as plectoneme @xcite . \\n while this behavior has been well characterized both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , its analog for highly extensible filaments has been ignored . in particular , for large extensional and twisting strains qualitatively different solutions arise , such as those corresponding to tightly packed solenoidal structures @xcite whose properties are as yet poorly understood .        given the broad scope of our computational framework for the investigation of soft filaments dynamics , we now study the formation of solenoids and plectonemes . as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : solenoidsplectonemes]a , a soft rod of young s modulus @xmath376  pa is clamped at one end , and subject to an axial load @xmath277 , while also being twisted @xmath377 times at the other end . as \\n experimentally and theoretically observed for @xmath378 , i.e. in the absence of stretching ( @xmath379 ) , plectonemes are generated ( fig . \\n [ fig : solenoidsplectonemes]b ) . when the load @xmath277 is increased so that the elongation of the rod approaches @xmath380 , solenoids arise as predicted in @xcite and illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : solenoidsplectonemes]c . \\n this test case , therefore , shows the ability of our solver to capture qualitatively different instability mechanisms , driven by the competition between the different modes of deformation of the rod . \\n we leave the details of the explanation of the phase diagram for the formation of plectonemes , solenoids and intermediate structures @xcite for a later study . \\n the mechanics of slithering locomotion typical of snakes has been extensively investigated experimentally @xcite , theoretically @xcite and computationally @xcite . \\n while biological experiments have provided quantitative insights , theoretical and computational models have been instrumental to characterize qualitatively the working principles underlying snake locomotion . \\n although these models implement different levels of realism , they generally rely on a number of key simplifications . \\n typically , theoretical models assume planar deformations @xcite and/or disregard mechanics by prescribing body kinematics @xcite . \\n computational models offer a more realistic representation , but they have mostly been developed for and tailored to robotic applications @xcite . \\n for example , snakes are often modeled as a relatively small set of hinges and/or springs representing pointwise localized actuators that connect contiguous rigid segments . \\n therefore , they do not account for the continuum nature of elastic body mechanics and biological muscular activity . \\n moreover , in robot replicas the critical feature of friction anisotropy ( section  [ sec : isovsani_app ] of the _ appendix _ ) is commonly achieved through the use of wheels @xcite . as a consequence computational models often assume only two sources of anisotropy , in the tangential and lateral direction with respect to the body . \\n this is in contrast with biological experiments @xcite that highlight the importance of all three sources of anisotropy , namely forward , backward and lateral . \\n our approach complements these previous attempts by accounting for physical and biological effects within a continuum framework ( eqs . \\n [ eq : velfinal]-[eq : angmomentfinal ] ) . in this section \\n we demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative capabilities of the proposed method by reverse engineering optimal slithering gaits that maximize forward speed . \\n we consider a soft filament of unit length actuated via a planar traveling torque wave of muscular activity in the direction perpendicular to the ground . \\n the interaction with the substrate is characterized by the ratios @xmath381 and @xmath382 with @xmath383 , as experimentally observed for juvenile pueblan milk snakes on a moderately rough surface @xcite . \\n the actual value of the friction coefficient @xmath384 is set so that the ratio between inertial and friction forces captured by the froude number is @xmath385 , as measured for these snakes @xcite .    in the spirit of @xcite , we wish to identify the fastest gaits by optimizing the filament muscular activity . the torque wave generated by the snake is parameterized according to section  [ sec : muscularactivity ] and is characterized by @xmath386 control points and a unit oscillation period @xmath189 , so that overall we optimize for five parameters , four of which are responsible for the amplitude profile along the rod ( @xmath387 , @xmath388 , @xmath389 , @xmath390 ) , while the last one represents the wavenumber @xmath391 ( see section  [ sec : muscularactivity ] ) .    these parameters are let free to evolve from an initial zero value , guided by an automated optimization procedure that identifies the optimal values that maximize the snake s forward average speed @xmath392 over one activation cycle @xmath189 . \\n the algorithm of choice is the covariance matrix adaptation - evolution strategy@xcite ( cma - es ) which has been proven effective in a range of biophysical and engineering problems , from the optimization of swimming gaits @xcite , morphologies @xcite and collective dynamics @xcite to the identification of aircraft alleviation schemes @xcite or virus traffic mechanisms @xcite . \\n the cma - es is a stochastic optimization algorithm that samples generations of @xmath393 parameter vectors from a multivariate gaussian distribution @xmath394 . here \\n each parameter vector represents a muscular activation instance , and every generation entails the evaluation of @xmath395 different gaits . \\n the covariance matrix of the distribution @xmath394 is then adapted based on successful past gaits , chosen according to their corresponding cost function value @xmath396 , until convergence to the optimum . \\n the course of the optimization is reported in fig . \\n [ fig : optimizedsnake ] together with the kinematic details of the identified fastest gait . \\n as can be noticed in fig . \\n [ fig : optimizedsnake]e , f the forward scaled average speed approaches @xmath397 , consistent with experimental evidences @xcite . \\n moreover , cma - es finds that the optimal wavelength is @xmath398 ( fig . \\n [ fig : optimizedsnake]g ) , again consistent with biological observations @xcite . \\n thus , this value of wavelength strikes a balance between thrust production and drag minimization within the mechanic constraints of the system . \\n we note that a rigorous characterization of slithering locomotion from an optimality standpoint would require the knowledge of a number of biologically relevant parameters ( young s and shear moduli of muscular tissue , maximum attainable torques , etc ) and environmental conditions ( terrain asperities , presence of pegs , etc ) and goes beyond the scope of the present work . \\n nevertheless , this study illustrates the robustness , quantitative accuracy and suitability of our methodology for the characterization of bio - locomotion phenomena . \\n we finally turn to apply the inverse design approach outlined in the previous section to the problem of swimming at low reynolds numbers where viscous forces dominate inertial effects . \\n we maintain the exact same set up as in the slithering case , while we change the environment from a solid substrate to a viscous fluid . \\n the flow - filament interaction is then modeled via slender - body theory , as illustrated in section  [ sec : hydro ] . \\n once again we inverse design planar optimal gaits for forward average speed @xmath396 within one activation cycle @xmath189 , by employing the same muscular activity parameterization as for slithering . in order to verify _ a - posteriori _ the biological relevance of the identified optimal solution , we consider the case of the sea urchin spermatozoon _ echinus esculentus _ \\n @xcite which swims by means of helical or planar waves traveling along its flagella of length @xmath399  @xmath270 m \\n . the gait corresponding to planar swimming is characterized by kinematic undulations of wavelength @xmath400 and frequency @xmath401 . at @xmath402 \\n the spermatozoon attains the scaled velocity @xmath403 , where @xmath404 is the dimensional cruise speed @xcite . \\n although this gait may not be the absolute optimal planar locomotion pattern , the fact that it is replicated in a large number of organisms @xcite suggests that it captures some effective features that we expect to qualitatively recover via our numerical optimization . \\n the course of the optimization is reported in fig . \\n [ fig : optimizedstokeslateral ] together with the kinematic details of the identified fastest gait . as can be noticed in fig . \\n [ fig : optimizedstokeslateral]e , f the forward average scaled speed and wavelength approach @xmath405 and @xmath406 , qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with experimental evidences @xcite . \\n as in the previous section , we note that a rigorous characterization of swimming at low reynolds numbers from an optimality standpoint would require the knowledge of a number of biologically relevant parameters and environmental conditions , and goes beyond the scope of the present work . \\n nevertheless , this and the previous study illustrate how the interplay between filament mechanics and the surrounding environment crucially affects propulsive gaits , as is biologically evident and automatically recovered via our numerical inverse design approach . \\n this provides us with further confidence in the reliability of our approach . \\n we have presented a generic numerical method for the simulation of soft filaments deforming in three dimensional space . \\n our scheme accounts at any given cross section for all possible deformation degrees of freedom , namely normal and orthonormal bending and shearing , twisting and stretching . \\n furthermore , we enhance it to handle self - contact , muscular activity , solid boundaries , isotropic and anisotropic friction as well as hydrodynamics . \\n the outcome is a relatively simple algorithm able to simulate a plethora of physical and biological phenomena . \\n we validate the proposed method over a battery of benchmark problems entailing different physical aspects and boundary conditions , and we examine its convergence properties in depth . \\n we further showcase the capabilities of our approach by studying the formation of solenoids and plectonemes , and by combining it with an evolution optimization strategy for the characterization of terrestrial limbless locomotion and swimming . \\n our results demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our discrete model as well as its qualitative and quantitative accuracy . \\n ongoing work involves its coupling to realistic high reynolds number flow solvers @xcite as well as its integration with sensory feedback models for the characterization of locomotory neural circuitry @xcite . \\n definition of material frame @xmath407    definition of time and space derivatives of frame directors @xmath408    time and space derivative relationships between laboratory and material frames @xmath409    angular momentum governing equation ( lab frame ) @xmath410    because the second moment of inertia is defined in the material frame , the governing equation for the angular momentum is most naturally expressed in the material frame as well ( @xmath42 in the lab frame is a function of space ant time rendering its use cumbersome , while @xmath411 is a constant and , in our isotropic case , diagonal matrix in the material frame ) . \\n we can use eqs .   and to convert all of the terms in eq .   to the material frame . \\n @xmath412    multiplying by @xmath16 and noting that @xmath413 yields our final governing equation for the angular momentum , expressed in the material frame    @xmath414 \\n we briefly derive here the analytical expression of the vertical displacement @xmath362 of eq . \\n ( [ eq : displacementtimo ] ) for the cantilever beam problem of fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]a . in order to do \\n so we make use of the free body diagram of fig . \\n [ fig : freebodydiagram_app ] , and of the constitutive relations of table [ tab : strains ] and eqs . \\n ( [ eq : bendinglaws ] , [ eq : shearlaws ] ) . moreover , we disregard axial extension and assume small deformations so that the coordinate @xmath368 ( along the direction @xmath293 ) is approximated by the arc - length @xmath9 .    recalling that the bending strain is the space derivative of the bending angle @xmath415 ( fig . \\n [ fig : freebodydiagram_app ] ) , we may write @xmath416 where @xmath417 is the bending moment , @xmath82 the young s modulus , and @xmath418 is the second area moment of inertia about the axis @xmath367 ( see fig . \\n [ fig : timoshenko_conv]a ) . the shear angle @xmath121 , as illustrated in fig . \\n [ fig : freebodydiagram_app ] , is the difference between the bending angle and the slope of the centerline , so that @xmath419 where @xmath420 is the shear force , @xmath33 is the cross sectional area , @xmath83 is the shear modulus , and @xmath421 is the timoshenko factor @xcite . if a point load @xmath277 is applied downward at @xmath422 , where @xmath0 is the length of the rod , a free body diagram of the beam yields @xmath423 and @xmath424 , so that @xmath425    by integrating eq . \\n ( [ eq : beamelastic2_app ] ) with boundary conditions @xmath426 at @xmath427 , injecting the solution @xmath415 into eq . \\n ( [ eq : beamshear2_app ] ) , and integrating again with boundary conditions @xmath428 at @xmath427 , we obtain @xmath429 \\n here we validate the friction model introduced in section [ sec : friction ] on three test cases that can be analytically characterized . in all benchmarks \\n we consider a rigid , unshearable , inextensible straight rod of mass @xmath430 , length @xmath0 , radius @xmath1 , axial mass second moment of inertia @xmath431 . \\n the rod interacts with a surface characterized by static and kinetic friction coefficients @xmath230 and @xmath229 , thus assuming isotropic friction .        in the first test \\n the rod is initially at rest on a plane inclined of the angle @xmath432 , as depicted in fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefriction_app]a . \\n due to the gravitational acceleration @xmath323 the rod starts rolling or slipping , depending on @xmath432 , down the plane . \\n the linear @xmath433 and angular @xmath434 velocities of the filament , and therefore the corresponding translational @xmath435 and rotational @xmath436 energies can be analytically determined .    by recalling eq . \\n ( [ eq : noslipforcerotation ] ) , the force necessary to ensure rolling without slip takes the form @xmath437 . given the maximum static friction force @xmath438 in the case @xmath439 we have @xmath440 . \\n therefore , at the time @xmath441 after releasing the rod , linear and angular velocities read , respectively , @xmath442 and @xmath443 expressing the no slip kinematic constraint between linear @xmath260 and angular @xmath444 accelerations . on the contrary , if @xmath445 the rod starts slipping and linear and angular accelerations are no longer coupled , so that after the time @xmath441 we have @xmath446 , @xmath442 , @xmath447 . \\n therefore , translational and rotational energies as a function of @xmath432 finally read @xmath448 ^ 2}{2 }               & \\\\text{if }   |f_{\\\\text{noslip}}|>|f_s| \\\\end{dcases}\\\\ ] ] and @xmath449 as can be noticed in fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefriction_app]b , our numerical approach faithfully reproduces the derived analytical solution , accurately capturing the discontinuity at the transition between pure rolling and slipping .    the second test case of fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefriction_app]c , d entails a rod set in motion by the external couple @xmath450 on a horizontal plane . \\n depending on the magnitude of the load the filament exhibits pure rolling or slipping motion . by recalling eq . \\n ( [ eq : noslipforcerotation ] ) , the force necessary to ensure rolling without slip takes the form @xmath451 . given the maximum static friction force @xmath452 in the case @xmath439 we have @xmath453 . \\n therefore , at the time @xmath441 after releasing the rod , linear and angular velocities read , respectively , @xmath442 and @xmath443 expressing the no slip kinematic constraint between linear @xmath260 and angular @xmath444 accelerations . on the contrary , if @xmath445 the rod starts slipping and linear and angular accelerations are no longer coupled , so that after the time @xmath441 we have @xmath454 , @xmath442 , @xmath455 . therefore , translational and rotational energies as a function of @xmath450 finally read @xmath456 and @xmath457 as can be noticed in fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefriction_app]d , again our numerical approach faithfully reproduces the derived analytical solution , accurately capturing the discontinuity at the transition between pure rolling and slipping .    in the last test case we consider a rod of initial velocity @xmath458 in the direction parallel to a horizontal plane and perpendicular to the filament axis ( fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefriction_app]e ) , and we vary the relative mass moment of inertia ratio @xmath459 . \\n initially the rod slips on the surface and gradually slows down , due to the effect of the kinetic friction , to a point for which linear @xmath260 and angular velocity @xmath434 meet the kinematic constraint @xmath460 characteristic of pure rolling motion . \\n the frictional force @xmath277 induces the torque @xmath461 , so that over a period of time @xmath441 we have @xmath462 and @xmath463 . by enforcing the no slip kinematic constraint @xmath464 \\n , we have that @xmath465 . \\n this allows us to directly compute @xmath466 and @xmath467 and the corresponding translational and rotational energies , yielding @xmath468 as depicted in fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefriction_app]f , our numerical approach accurately reproduces the predicted energies as a function of @xmath469 .      after validating our rolling friction model \\n , we turn to its longitudinal counterpart . \\n here we consider a straight , rigid , inextensible and unshearable rod which is axially pulled or pushed with force @xmath112 for a fixed period of time @xmath441 ( fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefrictionaxial_app ] ) . \\n anisotrpy is captured through the forward @xmath470 , @xmath384 and backward @xmath471 , @xmath472 static and kinetic coefficients . for @xmath473 \\n the rod translational energy takes the form @xmath474 while for @xmath475 we have @xmath476 as can be seen in fig . \\n [ fig : surfcefrictionaxial_app ] , our numerical method reproduces the above theoretical predictions .          in this section \\n we illustrate the effect of symmetry breaking via anisotropic friction in a system constituted by a soft filament interacting via surface friction with a solid substrate . \\n if we consider isotropic friction and a specular muscular activation pattern by setting the control values @xmath477 and @xmath478 and the wave number @xmath479 ( see section  [ sec : muscularactivity ] ) , then the system is symmetric ( up to inertial effects that can be neglected for small froude numbers ) . \\n therefore , over any activation cycle the snake center of mass does not move . on the contrary , \\n if we introduce anisotropy the snake will be able to slowly move ( the capability to effectively move is impaired by the absence of the traveling gait component since @xmath479 ) .    as can be observed in fig . \\n [ fig : isoanisotrpicfriction_app ] , this prediction is captured by our numerical scheme , which accurately resolves the physical mechanisms at play . moreover \\n , this test shows once again how our methodology is robust in terms of numerical noise as no spurious displacements or rotations are generated in the symmetric case ( fig . \\n [ fig : isoanisotrpicfriction_app]a , b ) .

local , and long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) , such as structured ground states @xcite , solitons @xcite , and roton - maxon spectra @xcite . \\n dipolar condensates have recently been realized with atoms of @xmath1cr @xcite , @xmath0dy @xcite and @xmath2er @xcite . \\n furthermore , there has been vast progress in the realization of a condensate with polar molecules with an electric dipole moment @xcite . \\n two examples for the recent study of effects due to the ddi have been the experimental investigation of the collapse dynamics @xcite and the inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud @xcite of a dipolar @xmath1cr bec . in the former case \\n the scattering length was ramped down below the collapse threshold and absorption images were made after the collapse and explosion of the condensate . \\n the density distribution inherited the d - wave symmetry @xmath3 of the ddi . in the latter case \\n the dipolar forces were shown to inhibit the inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud , which usually occurs during a time of flight . \\n an exhaustive review of the physics of dipolar quantum gases has recently been given by lahaye _ \\n _ @xcite and baranov _ et al . \\n _ @xcite .    in this paper \\n , we use the extended gross - pitaevskii equation to calculate the dynamics of a condensate , which yields an accurate description for sufficiently low temperatures and reads    @xmath4    with @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the number of particles , @xmath7 is the dipole length , and @xmath8 denotes the scattering length . \\n the dipoles are aligned along the @xmath9-axis , such that @xmath10 is the angle between the @xmath9-axis and the vector @xmath11 . \\n this form implies that all lengths are scaled in units of @xmath12 and all energies in units of @xmath13 . \\n the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 control the strength of the scattering and the dipole interaction , respectively , and are assumed to be independently adjustable . \\n the ratio @xmath16 is a measure for the importance of the dipole interaction . \\n the strength of short - ranged interactions , which can be described by a fermi - like contact interaction , can be controlled by means of a feshbach - resonance @xcite . \\n an external magnetic field changes the coupling between a bound state and a state of an incoming particle and allows for the control of the scattering length . \\n this can be used to increase @xmath17 and therefore to enhance the dipolar character of the condensate . \\n however , since feshbach - resonances reduce the lifetime of a condensate , one prefers the realization of condensates with larger magnetic moments . \\n of all the above mentioned species with permanent magnetic dipole moments , @xmath0dy stands out with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the bohr magneton . \\n our results can be scaled and are therefore valid for all dipolar systems . \\n however , we are in particular interested in a condensate with @xmath0dy , which means that in the following all parameters are adjusted to fit the needs of a condensate with this species . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first fully numerical three - dimensional study for a realistic set of parameters close to those in actual experimental setups . \\n we emphasize that our calculations do not depend on any further simplifications or restrictions beyond the use of a mean - field ansatz .    in the next section \\n we give a short introduction to our numerical method and present our results with respect to expansion dynamics , structured ground states and a self - induced josephson junction . \\n we solve the gross - pitaevskii equation numerically exact on a grid by means of the split - operator method using the imaginary- and real - time evolution . \\n this yields a series of fourier transforms , which we evaluate with a highly parallelized algorithm using the cuda - architecture of nvidia . a more detailed overview is given in @xcite . for the calculation of stability and phase diagrams \\n we start with a simple gaussian for a set of parameters far away from the stability border . \\n this border is given by the maximum value ( in this paper either the angle of rotation @xmath20 or the number of particles @xmath6 ) for which the imaginary - time evolution converges and a stationary ground state exists . \\n after the calculation of the ground state , we use this wave function as the initial wave function for the calculation of the next set of parameters , where we keep the aspect ratio or @xmath17 constant until we reach the stability border . since our computational ressources allow for a very small step size \\n , we can make very precise predictions with respect to stability and phase diagrams . \\n one possible setup for the experimental investigation of dipolar signatures in condensates is to tilt the polarization axis with respect to the external confinement by means of an external magnetic field and investigate its expansion dynamics . \\n the influence of the ddi should manifest itself in a deviation of the expansion dynamics as compared to a condensate which is strongly dominated by isotropic short - ranged interactions . \\n the most clear evidence would be a tof ( time of flight ) sequence in which the direction of the largest width of the cloud coincides with the polarization axis , regardless of the initial confinement . in this paper \\n we study the equivalent scenario , where we rotate the external trap and the dipoles remain permanently aligned in @xmath9-direction . \\n a tilt of the polarization axis clockwise in the @xmath21-plane corresponds to a rotation of the trap anti - clockwise along the @xmath22-direction . \\n the corresponding transformation of the coordinates reads    @xmath23    fig . \\n [ fig : expansion ] shows absorption images of three tof sequences with @xmath24 and different rotation angles @xmath20 . for absorption images in the @xmath22- and @xmath9-direction \\n we integrate @xmath25 along the @xmath22- and @xmath9-axis , respectively . \\n the first seqence at the top shows a tof for initial harmonic trapping with @xmath26 hz and @xmath27 , where we have used the trapping parameters from @xcite . since an anisotropic confinement yields an anisotropic momentum distribution \\n , we see an inversion of the aspect ratio of the cloud . \\n the tof does not show any signature of the dipole - dipole interaction since the dynamics of the condensate is dominated almost entirely by the anisotropic momentum distribution . \\n therefore in the middle panels we reduce the aspect ratio of the trap and adjust the confinement to @xmath28 hz and @xmath29 . for this setup \\n the dynamics of the condensate is in stark contrast to the tof above since the expansion seems to be governed by the direction of the strongest initial confinement and the polarization axis . \\n this can be cleary seen by the fact , that the direction of smallest width for 0 ms is not the direction which dominates the tof , as is the case for the sequence above . \\n therefore this expansion dynamics strikes a balance between the direction that is given by the anisotropic momentum distribution and the polarization direction which is energetically preferable . \\n the last tof shows absorption images in @xmath9-direction for @xmath26 hz and @xmath30 . \\n here we see a blood - cell structured condensate where the density peak is away from the center @xcite , which occurs about 6 ms after the release from the trap ( for better visibility see fig . \\n [ fig:1d_absorption_image ] ) . \\n note that the initial density distribution in the @xmath31-plane is given by a gaussian . \\n therefore the structured state is not an artifact from the stationary ground state but rather a product of the expansion dynamics . \\n the crucial parameter for the experimental oberservation of structured states is the visibility    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    with @xmath34 as the maximum value and @xmath35 as the value in the center of the plane . \\n the visibility @xmath36 should be at least at about 0.1 to allow for a high - contrast imaging of the density distribution . \\n it turns out that for all angles @xmath20 the visibility is smaller than this benchmark . for the smallest angle @xmath30 \\n we find @xmath37 , whereas for @xmath38 the corresponding visibility is @xmath39 . \\n additionaly , as can be seen in fig . \\n [ fig:1d_absorption_image ] , where we depict the quantities    @xmath40    the rotation of the external confinement destroys the rotational symmetry in the @xmath31-plane and leads to a saddle - shaped structured state . \\n the small value of @xmath36 during the expansion dynamics suggests that such structured states can only be seen if modern imaging systems are further improved or systems with very large dipolar moments such as polar molecules are used . \\n structured states are not only a feature of dynamical processes , but do occur as stationary ground states as well . in this section \\n we investigate where in the parameter space these structured states occur and if their visibility is large enough to satisfy the above mentioned criterion of @xmath41 . \\n [ fig : stability_visibility ] depicts the stability border for four different values of @xmath17 and a phase diagram of the visibility of structured ground states for @xmath42 with respect to the angle of rotation @xmath20 and the aspect ratio of the trap @xmath43 with @xmath44 hz , and @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 particles . \\n an increase of the angle of rotation or a reduction of the aspect ratio results in more dipoles in the attractive head - to - tail configuration , and thus destabilizes the condensate . \\n these parameters are therefore crucial for the stability properties of a dipolar condensate and can be used to investigate its stability borders . \\n experimentally one would prefer to change the axis of polarization as opposed to the aspect ratio of the trap since this axis can be easily controlled by an external magnetic field . \\n as one would expect , smaller values of @xmath17 , which correspond to a condensate less dominated by the ddi , stabilize the condensate against larger angles of rotation and smaller aspect ratios . \\n structured states can be found in the vicinity of the border of stability . \\n here we find a broad strip in which @xmath47 . for low values of @xmath20 , these structures resemble the blood - cell - like structured condensates ( in the plane @xmath48 polarization axis ) which also occur during the tof ( see fig .  [ \\n fig : expansion ] ) . \\n the spatial size of the structures is limited by the external confinement . here \\n the diameter of the ring @xmath49 1 @xmath50 m . \\n this should be sufficient for an experimental observation . \\n one fascinating feature of dipolar condensates is the possibility of a self - induced josephson junction , where the effective potential consisting of the external confinement and the dipolar potential has the form of a double well . \\n these systems show well known phenomena such as josephson oscillations or running phase modes @xcite . in this subsection \\n we are again interested in stability borders , now with respect to the number of particles @xmath6 , the angle of rotation @xmath20 , and @xmath17 . \\n the self - induced josephson junction can be realized by adding a toroidal potential to the external confinement . \\n the external potential then reads    @xmath51    with @xmath52 ( 2.5 @xmath50k ) and @xmath53 ( 5 @xmath50 m ) . for @xmath30 the gaussian potential is in the @xmath31-plane and therefore perpendicular to the axis of polarization . \\n this is the most stable configuration of the toroidal confinement since most of the dipoles are in the repulsive side - by - side configuration and arranged in a circle . \\n if we rotate the trap until we attain @xmath54 , the axis of polarization and the gaussian potential will be in the same plane and we obtain the anisotropic density distribution which corresponds to a double - well potential . \\n [ fig : stability_josephson ] depicts the stability diagrams with respect to the number of particles @xmath6 and @xmath17 as well as the angle of rotation @xmath20 and @xmath17 . for the first diagram we have chosen @xmath54 and @xmath55 hz and depict the stability diagram for four different values of @xmath56 . \\n as can be seen , self - induced josephson junctions can not be realized with large numbers of @xmath0dy particles . \\n but it is possible to increase the number of particles by reducing the harmonic confinement @xmath56 . this leads to more dipoles in the repulsive side - by - side configuration and thus stabilizes the condensate . a more effective way of stabilizing the condensate is to choose a smaller angle of rotation . \\n for the stability diagram with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath17 we have chosen three different values for the number of particles and @xmath57 hz . \\n we see again that reducing the number of particles stabilizes the condensate , and also that the reduction of @xmath20 allows for a greater amount of particles in the condensate . \\n the calculation of stability diagrams allows for the search of new quantum states along the stability border of the self - induced josephson junction . \\n indeed , we find a new stationary state whose density distribution corresponds to the macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) state known from double - well potentials @xcite , in which only one well is occupied . \\n we find this state in a small strip along the stability border in fig . \\n [ fig : stability_josephson ] a ) for @xmath58 . fig . \\n [ fig : mqst ] depicts the one- and two - dimensional absorption images in @xmath59-direction of this state , where @xmath60 is calculated analogously to . \\n this state is robust with respect to small experimental imperfections like small perturbations in the horizontality of the toroidal trap . \\n indeed , the whole trap , as well as exclusively , the toroidal trap , may be rotated by several degrees without destroying this mqst - like state . \\n further imperfections like gradients in the magnetic field may affect in which well the particles of the condensate accumulate , but we do not expect any further consequences due to the small magnitude of the gradient ( usually @xmath61 1 gauss / cm ) . \\n nonetheless , the effect of small gradients upon the accumulation of the particles can be investigated by aligning the dipoles parallel to the @xmath22-axis . \\n note that disturbances in general can result in a shift of the stability diagram , thus slightly changing the parameters where structured states are expected to appear . \\n signatures of this mqst - like state can also be observed in the dynamics of josephson junctions , where a large initial imbalance in the occupation of the wells can not be periodically compensated and is therefore dominated by the self trapping in one well . \\n this results in a running phase mode , where the creation of vortex - antivortex pairs in regions of small density is responsible for a phase shift @xcite . \\n we have presented a series of stability and phase diagrams with respect to parameters which are of great importance for the experimental investigation of a dipolar bec . \\n our results are valid for all dipolar systems , but we have adjusted all parameters to fit the needs of a condensate with @xmath0dy . \\n we studied the expansion dynamics of a dipolar condensate and found two sorts of dipolar signatures occurring during tof sequences : the effects of the ddi are noticeable in that the width of the spatially expanding cloud is not only governed by the anisotropic momentum distribution but also by the direction of the polarization axis . in addition , \\n structured states occur during the tof . \\n the analysis of stability diagrams shows that structured ground states can be found along the stability border and that their visibility is large enough for modern imaging systems . \\n we have shown that the realization of a self - induced josephson junction with @xmath0dy is restricted to a rather small amount of particles . however , \\n this can be compensated by a rotation of the external confinement or the polarization axis . \\n finally , the analysis of the stability diagram shows that large values of @xmath17 allow for a macroscopic quantum self - trapping state . \\n further investigations should include the determination of the scattering length @xmath8 of @xmath0dy , which can be accomplished by a comparison of experimentally measured and theoretically calculated in - trap radii and stability diagrams . \\n our results should therefore stimulate experimental efforts to study dipolar becs . \\n we thank holger kadau , thomas maier , matthias schmitt and tilman pfau for valuable discussions . \\n 22ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \\n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.98.030406 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\\\doibase 10.1103/physreva.80.063601 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.95.200404 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\\\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.85.023630 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.86.053611 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\\\doibase    10.1103/physreva.77.061601 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\\\doibase    10.1103/physrevlett.108.210401 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) link:\\\\doibase 10.1021/cr2003568 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\\\doibase 10.1103/revmodphys.82.1225 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\\\doibase 10.1038/32354 [ * * , ( ) ] ,   @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )\", 'dipolar bose -

positron annihilation to the same final states . with the increase in amount and quality of tau data , in recent years tests of cvc \\n have become limited by both the lack of comparably precise data from low energy @xmath17 colliders and the subtlety of systematic effects such as radiative corrections , separation of isoscalar components , and interference . \\n this situation is improving somewhat with recent data from the cmd2 and snd experiments operating at the vepp-2 m collider at binp in novosibirsk . \\n a compilation @xcite of the measured versus predicted branching fractions for vector - current modes shows a 2.4 standard deviation excess in the overall sum of tau rates compared with cvc prediction , with the excess concentrated in the two modes with largest branching fraction : @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see figs . \\n [ fig : fhpi0nu ] , [ fig : f3hpi0nu ] ) . at this point \\n it is too soon to tell whether this is significant given the experimental and theoretical subtleties involved . \\n further work is necessary , and improved data are expected on both tau and @xmath17 sides .    2.05 in    1.9 in \\n opal @xcite and delphi @xcite have new branching fraction results in several non - strange modes made possible by new understanding of how s can be detected in their calorimeters . for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : fhnu]-[fig : f5hpi0nu ] , the new entries are compatible with and comparable in precision to previous measurements . however , the preliminary delphi measurement of @xmath26 ( fig . \\n [ fig : f3hpi0nu ] ) is 2.5 standard deviations higher than the pdg98 fit value . \\n it is also 2.6 standard deviations from the cvc prediction for @xmath27 @xcite augmented by the nwa s for @xmath28 ( figs . \\n [ fig : fk2pipi0nu ] and [ fig : fkkpipi0nu ] ) .    1.8 in    1.45 in    2.2 in    1.6 in    1.8 in \\n there have also been new results on other high multiplicity final states . \\n cleo finalized their tau96 analysis @xcite on @xmath29 with a publication @xcite , reporting @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . \\n a new measurement @xcite of the @xmath33 branching fraction as ( 52.83.82.5)% allows reduction of the cleo systematic error , resulting in @xmath34 . in a related mode , cleo reports @xmath35 , finding that it is saturated by the above @xmath36 modes and the ( new ) @xmath37 final state with rate @xmath38 @xcite . \\n the older aleph measurement of @xmath39 @xcite is larger but consistent with the new cleo result ; although it should be noted that @xmath40 has not yet been measured directly . \\n measured six pion branching fractions ( for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are found to be consistent with isospin symmetry once the axial - vector @xmath43 contributions have been subtracted @xcite . finally , new upper limits on tau decays with seven charged particles plus neutrals have been made by opal @xcite ( 1.8@xmath44 at 95%cl ) and cleo @xcite ( 2.4@xmath45 at 90%cl ) . \\n much of the focus of new work on hadronic decays focused on modes with strange particles . \\n aleph presented a comprehensive analysis @xcite of 27 different modes , almost always measuring both @xmath2 and @xmath5 for modes with @xmath46 s . \\n 1.35 in      both aleph @xcite and delphi @xcite have new branching ratios for @xmath48 ; they are consistent with previous measurements , and aleph halves their previous ( smallest ) error , which improves the world average accordingly , as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : fknu ] . the aleph analysis uses this improved precision to test @xmath49 universality ( @xmath50 ) @xcite by comparing the decay rate to that of muonic kaon decay , and to determine the kaon decay constant , assuming lepton universality , as @xmath51 )  mev . \\n 2.0 in      aleph @xcite presented new results for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 final states . \\n [ fig : fkstnu ] shows the @xmath56 branching fraction , labeled by specific final state , assuming an isospin @xmath57 parent . \\n the cleo result remains about two standard deviations lower than the more precise combined aleph rate . \\n aleph also fits the @xmath58 spectrum for the presence of @xmath59 in addition to @xmath60 , and for interference between the two final states . \\n they obtain evidence for @xmath59 at the one to three standard deviation level , depending upon which parameters are fixed or allowed to float in the fit and which decay mode spectra are included . the @xmath59 admixture strength @xmath61 is determined to be @xmath16@xmath620.1 , similar to that measured for @xmath63 in @xmath64 @xcite . \\n the net branching fraction is measured as @xmath65=(0.15@xmath66)% . as @xmath59 decays 93% of the time to @xmath67 , \\n this measurement yields the vector component background to the dominantly axial - vector @xmath67 final states \\n .      in analogy with tau decays to non - strange @xmath69 states , the production of @xmath67 is expected to occur through the axial - vector mesons @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite . however , immediate non - resonant fragmentation to @xmath72 or @xmath73 at the pointlike weak vertex , or production through the strange vector meson @xmath59 ( see previous section ) , are also possible . \\n let @xmath74 and @xmath75 denote the triplet @xmath76 and singlet @xmath77 spin eigenstates , respectively , of @xmath78 , the strange analogs of the @xmath79 states , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . \\n production amplitudes of @xmath82 and @xmath75 in tau decay are suppressed in the sm as second - class currents by @xmath83 this factor is quite small for @xmath84 , accounting for the non - observation of @xmath82 in tau decays . \\n in contrast , the large strange quark mass induces substantial @xmath85 symmetry - breaking , allowing non - zero @xmath75 production in tau decay . \\n the strange axial - vector mass eigenstates are @xmath70 and @xmath71 . \\n @xmath70 decays to @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ; @xmath71 decays almost exclusively to @xmath88 . since @xmath74 and @xmath75 \\n are both predicted by @xmath90 to decay equally to @xmath88 and @xmath86 , and since the @xmath91 states do not , the @xmath91 resonances must correspond to mixtures of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in comparable amounts with opposite - sign phases . \\n one can parametrize this mixing in terms of an angle @xmath92 : @xmath93 @xmath94 the previously measured properties of the @xmath91 mesons place some restrictions on the allowed values of @xmath92 @xcite . \\n the relative amounts of @xmath70 and @xmath71 observed in tau decay can further constrain @xmath92 and yield the size of @xmath85 symmetry - breaking . \\n 1.7 in    1.2 in    aleph @xcite presented new information on all four possible @xmath95 final states , while cleo @xcite and delphi @xcite did so for the all - charged mode . \\n the updated aleph value @xmath96=(0.0560.025)% is now corrected for @xmath97 feed - down . \\n [ fig : fk0pipi0nu ] compare the cleo and aleph results for the @xmath46 modes , which are consistent , and fig . \\n [ fig : fk2pinu ] does the same for the @xmath98 mode , for which the three results differ substantially from one another . \\n the theoretical prediction from li @xcite of 0.18% is closer to the aleph and cleo result than finkemeier and mirkes @xcite prediction of 0.77% , which is much higher even than the delphi measurement . \\n cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite \\n have both made quantitative analyses of the resonance structure of @xmath67 decays . \\n cleo has @xmath168k events in @xmath98 with 38% background and is systematics - limited , while aleph has @xmath16300 events split between the @xmath98 and @xmath99 modes , each with @xmath1650% background . \\n cleo fits the sub - mass spectra for @xmath70 , @xmath71 amplitudes , strong phases in their @xmath100 and @xmath101 decays , and the mixing angle @xmath92 . accounting for the interference \\n is found to be important , as the two phases are about 5 and 1.7 standard deviations from zero : the predicted mass spectra match the data well only if these phases are included . \\n the @xmath70 is found to dominate , and cleo quotes the ratio of the two @xmath91 states as @xmath70/@xmath71=4.10.5@xmath102 . \\n the final state @xmath86 is found to be ( 4512)% of @xmath98 . \\n finally , the mixing angle is determined within a two - fold ambiguity to be ( 67  or  46)10 , close to the values obtained from @xmath91 widths and branching fractions @xcite of ( 57  or  33 ) .    in contrast , aleph assumes the @xmath95 state appears as an _ \\n incoherent _ superposition of @xmath86 and @xmath88 , finding @xmath86 to be ( 3511)% of @xmath98 and  ( 6612)% of @xmath99 ( consistent with isospin symmetry ) , the fraction of @xmath70 in the final states to be @xmath103% , and the branching fraction @xmath104% . \\n so , while aleph and cleo use different assumptions and analyze their data differently , qualitatively , they agree that @xmath86 is a significant presence in @xmath95 decays , and therefore that @xmath70 plays a major role as a source of these final states \\n .    another final state may proceed through the @xmath91 resonance . \\n cleo @xcite has found @xmath105=(2.90.80.4)@xmath106 , finding that the @xmath107 is dominant in @xmath108 decays . \\n li @xcite predicts that this final state proceeds through the @xmath91 axial - vector current , and , using an effective chiral theory in the limit of chiral symmetry , predicts a branching fraction of ( 1.01@xmath106 ) . in contrast , pich @xcite predicts a rate for @xmath108 of @xmath109 using chiral perturbation theory . \\n aleph @xcite and cleo @xcite both look for @xmath111 final states , do not obtain definitive signals for any of them , but determine sub-0.1% branching fractions . \\n [ fig : fk2pipi0nu ] shows the measurements for @xmath112 , which are consistent with each other . \\n aleph also measures @xmath113% , @xmath114% , and @xmath115% . \\n 1.3 in    1.2 in      aleph @xcite has combined the spectral information from @xmath58 and @xmath95 decays with small additions from monte carlo for @xmath116 modes to determine the total strange spectral function . using this and the strange - quark mass dependence of the qcd expansion for the hadronic decay width of the tau \\n , aleph obtains @xmath117(1  gev@xmath118)@xmath119  mev . \\n 1.8 in    0.85 in    1.65 in    1.1 in      the production of @xmath123 or @xmath124 states in tau decay is suppressed by phase space , but could occur via direct fragmentation or through the high - mass tails of the @xmath125 , @xmath126 , or @xmath127 : @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , or @xmath131 . \\n aleph and cleo have new results in many of these modes , including @xmath132 , as shown in figs . \\n [ fig : fkk0nu]-[fig : fkkpipi0nu ] . \\n there are no major inconsistencies in the measured branching fractions , which are typically @xmath160.1% . \\n the observation by cleo of @xmath133 content in @xmath134 events is quantitatively consistent with the measured branching ratio : that analysis @xcite determines @xmath135=(3.30.50.1)% , which results in the prediction for the @xmath136 branching fraction shown in fig .  [ \\n fig : fkkpinu ] .    the aleph spectrum for @xmath137 does not match the model expectation for @xmath138 , in agreement with the conclusion of cleo @xcite . \\n the aleph analysis also favors @xmath133 parentage over @xmath139 in @xmath140 states , and quotes an axial - vector current fraction of ( 94@xmath141)% based on cvc and the absence of @xmath140 in @xmath17 data . \\n some comments on the @xmath142 final state @xcite are in order . \\n aleph sees 68 @xmath143 events and 6 in @xmath144 , compared to cleo s 52 events @xcite in the latter mode only . if the @xmath46 and @xmath145 decay independently , the @xmath143 mode should have double the rate of @xmath144 or @xmath146 . \\n however , bose - einstein correlations between the neutral kaons will violate this assumption . \\n the aleph measurement @xcite of @xmath147 is two standard deviations higher than double the nwa @xmath148 , suggestive that such an effect may be in force , but errors are currently too high for any definitive conclusion . \\n some perspective on recent experimental accomplishments can be gained by answering some of the questions i posed in the tau94 proceedings @xcite : _ will the global branching fractions of aleph continue to dominate most modes , or can we expect comparably precise results from other experiments ? _ aleph still sets the experimental standard for comprehensive treatment of hadronic tau decays , due to a combination of the clean tau - pair topology at lep energies , a superbly designed and maintained detector , hard work , and aggressive analysis . \\n this is particularly true of decays involving a , or a charged kaon _ and _ s , or modes with multiple s . \\n cleo competes best on modes with s and/or with branching fractions below 1% where its large dataset can provide enough events . in a very welcome development , opal and delphi \\n have recently achieved better understandings of their detector systematics and are pressing or even surpassing aleph and cleo on selected modes . \\n it is a trend we hope can continue . \\n however , we all await aleph s final full - data - sample global analysis with trepidation ! \\n _ can we resolve branching fraction discrepancies in the @xmath18 and @xmath149 modes simply by improving measurements , making older , disagreeable values irrelevant ? \\n _ apparently so \\n .    _ can we develop procedures which allow a consistent accounting of modes with  decays ? _ \\n pdg96 @xcite adopted basis modes which excluded unseen , and measurements of modes with , dominated by aleph @xcite , have made the feed - across corrections feasible . \\n _ what are the masses and widths of the @xmath150 and @xmath151 in tau decay ? \\n _ aleph results have been published @xcite , but the preliminary results from cleo @xcite have not . \\n _ is all @xmath69 attributable to @xmath126 decays ? _ a poorly - phrased question ; better would have been `` are there intermediate states in @xmath69 that do not go through @xmath152 ? '' . \\n the cleo analysis @xcite shows that less than 70% of @xmath153 final states come from @xmath139 intermediate states , and in particular that isoscalars ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 amount to @xmath1620% of the branching fraction . \\n the cleo and delphi @xcite analyses also are suggestive of the presence of an @xmath156 at high @xmath157 mass . \\n _ is there evidence for scalar or non - resonant production of @xmath56 final states ? _ \\n no , but statistics are scarce for this study . \\n i should have asked `` is there evidence for @xmath59 in @xmath58 decays '' , to which the answer is , yes , from aleph @xcite .    _ are @xmath67 decays consistent with a mixture of @xmath70 and @xmath71 production ? \\n _ yes , and both cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite agree that @xmath70 amounts to a substantial fraction of the @xmath67 final state . \\n _ what is the mixing angle and strength of @xmath85 symmetry breaking in such decays \\n ? _ cleo has a preliminary analysis @xcite , which accounts for interference between the different intermediate states , in which the mixing angle is measured up to a two - fold ambiguity . \\n _ do @xmath67 final states have @xmath59 or non - resonant content ? \\n _ aleph @xcite has measured @xmath65=(0.15@xmath66)% , and so the branching fraction into @xmath67 can be computed . \\n statistics are too low to answer for non - resonant production \\n .    _ can all @xmath158 final states be described as @xmath159 and @xmath160 ? \\n if so , what resonances produce those states ? _ a complete spectral analysis of @xmath161 has yet to be done . \\n _ what is the resonant substructure in @xmath140 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 final states ? _ the @xmath140 final state seems to arise through the axial - vector current @xmath164 @xcite . \\n five and six pion final states are quite complex , but receive important contributions from @xmath165 and @xmath37 @xcite .    _ what is the rate for 7@xmath11 production in tau decay ? _ for seven charged pions with or without s , less than 2.4 parts per million @xcite . \\n no direct measurement of @xmath166 has been performed and only upper limits exist for @xmath167 .    _ is there any evidence for second - class currents in tau decay at expected or unexpected levels ? \\n _ sadly , nothing unexpected , and the expected levels have yet to be approached experimentally . \\n _ given the current status of measurements , where are the most promising places to look for deviations from the standard model in hadronic tau decays ? \\n _ recent effort has been focussed on rare , suppressed , or forbidden decays @xcite , and on cp - violation @xcite , but any standard model prediction is fair game .    looking ahead , as the lep and cleo  ii programs draw to a close , finalized , full - statistics data - sets should become available next year for analysis . \\n improved low - energy data for cvc tests should continue to emerge from the experiments at vepp-2 m . \\n considerably more hadronic tau physics awaits further mining of all these samples , both with high - statistics systematics - limited studies which need more time and data to mature , and for low - statistics searches which can benefit the most from additional luminosity . \\n experimenters should not be dissuaded from this pursuit by the somewhat disquieting over - consistency of many results ; surprise often lurks just beyond the horizon . \\n we should all look forward to a peek at something new at tau2000 . \\n i would like to thank other speakers for making their results available to me for the writing of this summary talk . \\n in particular , i benefitted greatly from communications with s.  chen , m.  davier , s.  eidelman , j.m . \\n lopez - garcia , and r.  sobie . \\n my fellow cleons continue to indulge my endless questions , especially j.  smith , i.  kravchenko , d.  besson , and a.  weinstein . \\n the organizers and secretariat are to be commended for hosting a productive and invigorating workshop . \\n the preparation of this manuscript was supported by the national science foundation . \\n 9 c.  caso  ( particle data group ) eur . \\n j.  c * 3 * ( 1998 ) 286 . \\n s.  menke , . \\n a.  hoecker , . \\n m.  schmidtler , . \\n m.  davier , . \\n barnett  ( particle data group ) phys . \\n d. * 54 * ( 1996 ) 256 . \\n k.  moenig , private communication . \\n s.  eidelman , . \\n k. ackerstaff  ( opal collaboration ) eur . \\n j.  c * 4 * ( 1998 ) 193 . \\n k. ackerstaff  ( opal collaboration ) cern - ep/98 - 090 ( june 1998 ) ( submitted to eur . \\n v.  shelkov , in _ proceedings of the fourth workshop on tau lepton physics _ , \\n september 1996 , edited by j.g . \\n smith and w.  toki , nucl .  phys . \\n b ( proc . suppl . ) * 55c * ( 1997 ) 195 . t. bergfeld  ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . \\n * 79 * ( 1997 ) 2406 . \\n d.  barberis  ( wa102 collaboration ) , hep - ex/9810003 ( september 1998 ) . \\n s.  anderson  ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . \\n lett . * 79 * ( 1997 ) 3814 . \\n k.  ackerstaff  ( opal collaboration ) , phys .  lett . \\n * b404 * ( 1997 ) 213 . \\n k.  edwards  ( cleo collaboration ) , phys . \\n d * 56 * ( 1997 ) 5297 . \\n s.  chen , . \\n r.  barate  ( aleph collaboration ) , aleph  98 - 083 ( september 1998 ) . \\n a.  andreazza , . \\n delphi collaboration , delphi 98 - 145 & ichep98 # 247 , ( june 1998 ) . \\n r.  barate  ( aleph collaboration ) , aleph  98 - 084 ( september 1998 ) . \\n r.  barate ,  ( aleph collaboration ) , z.  phys . * \\n c76 * ( 1997 ) 15 . \\n j.  urheim , in _ proceedings of the fourth workshop on tau lepton physics _ , \\n september 1996 , edited by j.g . \\n smith and w.  toki , nucl . \\n . suppl . ) * 55c * ( 1997 ) 359 . \\n ronan , in _ proceedings of the second workshop on tau lepton physics _ , \\n september 1992 , edited by k.k . \\n gan , world scientific ( 1993 ) , p.  225 . \\n m.  suzuki , phys . \\n rev . d*47 * ( 1993 ) 1252 . \\n m.  suzuki , phys . \\n rev . d*49 * ( 1994 ) 2634 . \\n lipkin , phys . \\n lett . b*303 * ( 1993 ) 119 . \\n b.  heltsley , in _ proceedings of the third workshop on tau lepton physics _ , \\n september 1994 , edited by l.  rolandi , nucl . \\n b ( proc . suppl . ) \\n * 40 * ( 1995 ) 413 . \\n i.  kravchenko , . \\n li , phys . \\n d * 55 * ( 1997 ) 1436 ;

based approaches using , for example , openmp @xcite . \\n the particle decomposition method and the force decomposition method are both based on a static decomposition of the system s force matrix . \\n particle decomposition assigns complete rows of the force matrix to a processor while force decomposition uses a block decomposition of this matrix . \\n as discussed by plimpton  @xcite , both methods are not ideal for simulations of large systems with short - range forces due to communication overhead . \\n in addition to this , the force decomposition method is subject to load balancing issues if the force matrix is not uniformly sparse .    in the spatial decomposition approach ( see , e.g. , ref . \\n @xcite ) , the simulation cell is divided into as many domains as there are processors . \\n each processor is then responsible for the calculations of forces on particles in one domain . \\n when a particle crosses the border between two domains , it is reassigned to the processor of the new domain . \\n spatial decomposition achieves very good parallel speedups under two conditions : the domains must be large enough so that most of the interactions happen between particles on the same processor , and the particle density system must be sufficiently homogeneous in order to achieve comparable computational loads on the processors . \\n strongly inhomogeneous systems do not satisfy the latter condition , and the efficiency of spatial decomposition for these systems is therefore reduced by load imbalances . \\n recently , a number of variations of the spatial decomposition approach have been developed @xcite . \\n these neutral territory methods have the potential to outperform traditional spatial decomposition for high levels of parallelism . \\n these methods are , however , not well suited to handle strongly inhomogeneous systems . \\n while it is fairly straightforward to parallelize md programs using openmp , this approach rarely leads to satisfactory speedups . \\n the reason for this are uncoordinated accesses to the particle data by the threads . in order to avoid race conditions particle updates \\n must be protected by synchronization constructs or newton s third law can not be exploited . \\n the performance is further degraded since accesses to the same particle by different threads may result in frequent transfers of cache lines between the cpu s . \\n task - based programming is a modern approach to parallel computing . \\n this technique uses high - level abstractions to subdivide the problem into small work units ( tasks ) without regard for details of the task execution on the hardware . \\n these techniques are generally most efficient if the number of tasks that can be executed concurrently is much larger than the number of available processors . \\n task - based programming and examples of task - based programming models are discussed in refs . \\n @xcite . \\n the cell task method described in this article uses a task - based programming model . \\n the method subdivides the calculation of the forces in a large number of small tasks . \\n these tasks are then executed according to a dependent task schedule that avoids access conflicts between the threads . \\n for sufficiently large systems this leads to excellent parallel speedups that are largely independent of the degree of homogeneity of the simulated system . \\n in addition to this , the algorithm relieves the user from technical considerations like the best subdivision of the system for a given number of processors . \\n the primary objective of this work was the design of an efficient parallel md algorithm that achieves high parallel speedups for large and strongly inhomogeneous systems . \\n secondary goals were consistent speedups for all numbers of processors and to make the method robust against external perturbations that might temporarily delay computations on individual processors .    the problems of spatial decomposition and simple thread - based approaches can both be traced to the kind of geometric information used by the methods . spatial decomposition fails to achieve a good load balance if the size of the processor domains exceeds the characteristic length scale of inhomogeneities in the system . in the simple thread - based approach on the other hand \\n the efficiency is reduced by the need for synchronization which is ultimately due to the fact that no geometric information is used at all . \\n these observations lead to the idea to use geometric information on a small length scale for the parallelization .    in order to avoid synchronization constructs during the calculation of forces on the particles \\n , one must ensure that two threads will never update the same particle at the same time . \\n this means that threads must keep a distance of @xmath1 between the particles on which they work . \\n fortunately , the necessary information to ensure this condition is readily available in many cases or it can be obtained easily . \\n most general purpose md codes use the so - called linked - cell technique @xcite to facilitate the construction of neighbor lists . in the linked - cell method , the simulation box is subdivided into a grid of small cells whose width is larger than @xmath0 and for each cell a linked list of the particles in the cell is constructed . \\n a particle can then interact only with particles in the same cell or one of its neighbors . \\n symbols in the respective grid cells.,width=272 ]    the proposed parallelization method reuses the data structures from the linked cell technique to partition the problem of the force calculation into tasks . a task in this method consists of the calculation of the forces on all particles in one grid cell . since particles in one cell \\n do only interact with particles in neighboring cells , two tasks can be executed concurrently if there are at least two grid cells between them in all directions . \\n tasks that fulfill this condition are called _ non - overlapping _ otherwise they are said to be _ \\n overlapping_. figure  [ figwave ] shows a two - dimensional example of a cell grid and a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel since they are non - overlapping . \\n the essence of the proposed algorithm is the following :    1 . \\n the particles are binned into grid cells ( as part of the linked cell technique ) . \\n the force calculation is broken into cell tasks . \\n a cell tasks consists of the calculation of forces on all particles in one grid cell . \\n the tasks are executed in parallel by a thread pool according to a dependent schedule that ensures that only non - overlapping tasks are executed simultaneously . \\n the algorithm does not assume that the execution of the tasks requires similar amounts of computing time . \\n even in a homogeneous system this might not be the case and in inhomogeneous systems a substantial amount of grid cells might in fact be empty . \\n notwithstanding , a good load balance is achieved if the tasks are dynamically scheduled rather then statically . \\n dynamic scheduling assigns the tasks to the threads as these finish previous tasks . \\n this keeps all threads busy and averages the imbalances . \\n in addition to this , dynamic scheduling limits the impact of external disturbances such as unrelated processes running on one of the cores or differences in memory access times . \\n if a processor is slowed down by external factors , other processors will take on a larger number of tasks , thereby minimizing the delay . \\n with static scheduling a delay of one processor leaves the rest of the system idling . \\n another positive side effect of the cell task algorithm is an improved memory access pattern . \\n particles in the same grid cell have similar sets of neighbors . \\n the calculation of the forces on particles in the same cell within the same task therefore leads to high cache reuse without a special ordering of the particles . \\n after the force calculation , the second most time - consuming part of an md simulation is usually the generation of the neighbor lists . in a program that uses the linked cell method \\n the neighbor lists are naturally generated for all particles in a grid cell at once . \\n for this reason it is straightforward to apply the cell task method to the generation of the neighbor lists . \\n the only difference to the force calculation is the kind of work performed by a cell task . during the neighbor list construction \\n a cell task constructs the neighbor lists of all particles in the task s cell . \\n an important difference between the force calculation and the generation of neighbor lists is the fact that the neighbor list generation never performs simultaneous particle updates . \\n for this reason , the tasks generating the neighbor lists could all be scheduled simultaneously . on the other hand , \\n the overhead of the dependent schedule is very low as long as the system is large enough to keep all processors busy . \\n this is since most of the overhead is incurred during the construction of the schedule , which is done only when the cell grid changes . \\n while there are no simultaneous particle updates , simultaneous updates of the neighbor list data structure can be a problem . \\n one way to solve this is that each task maintains a separate data structure for the neighbor lists of its particles . \\n other typical parts of md simulations like the integration of the equation of motion are usually implemented with simple loops over the particles that access only one particle at a time . \\n these loops can be parallelized using simple threading techniques since there are no synchronization concerns . \\n a central problem of the proposed algorithm is the generation and execution of a dependent task schedule that guarantees that only non - overlapping tasks run concurrently . \\n this section presents two algorithms for this problem named the _ forward _ and the _ backward wave method_.    the wave methods group the cell tasks into an ordered set of so - called _ \\n waves_. a wave is a set of non - overlapping tasks that can be scheduled independently . \\n there are many ways to generate a set of waves that will cover all cells . in order to keep the method efficient \\n , each wave should include as many cells as possible , and the number of dependencies between tasks should be low . the algorithm used in this work \\n is described in the appendix . \\n the grouping of the tasks into waves establishes a partial ordering of the tasks . \\n a simple scheduling method is to allow tasks in the same wave to run concurrently but to require that a wave must be completely finished before the next wave can start . \\n the problem of this algorithm is that it imposes a barrier after each wave which reduces its efficiency . \\n note , however , that this scheme can easily be implemented in an environment that does not allow for dependent task scheduling . \\n the wave methods use the ordering imposed by the waves to order the access to the grid cells by the tasks . \\n each grid cell is accessed by at most 27 tasks ( less for cells at the simulation box boundary ) . \\n the wave methods allow a task @xmath2 to execute as soon as all tasks from previous waves that access one of @xmath2 s cells are completed . \\n a further simplification is possible since the preceding tasks depend on each other . for each of its cells \\n @xmath2 only has to wait for the last task that accesses this cell before @xmath2 ( since the last task has already waited for all previous tasks accessing this cell ) . \\n the set of last tasks accessing any of @xmath2 s grid cells are called the direct predecessors of @xmath2 . \\n similarly the direct successors of @xmath2 are those tasks which have @xmath2 as a direct predecessor . \\n the scheduling algorithm of both wave methods uses an acyclic graph algorithm similar to the one described in the documentation of intel s threading building blocks library @xcite . \\n each task has a data structure that stores its grid cell , the number of its direct predecessors , a list of its direct successors and a reference counter . \\n the reference counter is initially set to the number of direct predecessors and all tasks that have no direct predecessors are added to the thread pools list of tasks that are ready for execution . \\n the execution of a a task involves the following steps :    1 . \\n the work associated with the task is carried out ( force calculation , neighbor list generation , etc . ) \\n the reference counter of all direct successors is decremented atomically . \\n 3 .   successor tasks whose reference counter becomes zero are added to the ready list . \\n the purpose of the wave algorithms is to generate for each task its number of direct predecessors and the list of its successors . \\n the forward wave method maintains a three - dimensional array @xmath3[ny][nz]$ ] that stores for each grid cell the index of the last task that has accessed the cell . \\n initially this array is initialized with a special marker ( -1 ) that indicates that the cell has not been accessed . \\n the algorithm loops over the waves in ascending order starting with the first wave . for each task in a wave \\n the following steps are performed :    1 . \\n for all cells accessed by the task , copy the corresponding element of @xmath4 into a list . \\n 2 .   eliminate duplicates and the special marker from the list . \\n the result is the task s set of direct predecessors . \\n 3 .   store the number of predecessors in the task structure . \\n 4 .   for each direct predecessor , add the task to its successor list . \\n initialize an empty successor list 6 . \\n overwrite elements of @xmath4 used in step 1 with the task s index . \\n a drawback of the forward wave algorithm is the fact that when a task is created by the algorithm , only the predecessors are known . since the tasks needs to store its list of successors rather than its predecessors it would simplify the task generation if the list of successors were known at the time when a task is created \\n this is achieved by the backward wave method . \\n the backward method works like the forward method , but it replaces the array @xmath4 with an array @xmath5[ny][nz]$ ] which stores for each grid cell the index of the next task that accesses the cell . the array is again initialized with the special marker , which now means that no further task accesses the cell . \\n the backward algorithm then creates the waves in reverse order from the last wave to the first . for each task in a wave the method performs the following steps :    1 . \\n for all cells accessed by the task , copy the corresponding element of @xmath6 into a list . \\n 2 .   eliminate duplicates and the special marker from the list . \\n store the result as the task s direct successor list . \\n 3 .   for all direct successors : increment the number of direct predecessors by one . \\n 4 .   initialize the task s number of direct predecessors to zero 5 . \\n overwrite elements of s used in step 1 with the task s index .      in order to be able to test the cell task algorithm in practice \\n , the method has been implemented in a general purpose parallel md code named @xcite . \\n this code has been developed for large - scale simulations using many - body potentials of the embedded - atom method type @xcite or the similar finnis - sinclair  @xcite and tight - binding second - moment potentials  @xcite . \\n the code already supported parallelization through spatial decomposition so that parallel speedups can be compared . \\n the implementation of the cell task method requires a software environment supporting task - based programming . \\n the current implementation of the cell task method makes use of intel s threading building blocks library ( tbb ) for the management of the thread pool and the tasks . \\n tbb is a c++ library that is available under an open - source license for many platforms  @xcite . \\n it should be noted however that other task - based programming systems , for example those described in refs . \\n @xcite or openmp , could probably be used as well to implement the cell task method . \\n since uses the linked - cell technique for the generation of the neighbor lists , the implementation of the wave method required relatively little changes to the code since most data structures were already in place and ready to use . the majority of the code that had to be developed concerns the task scheduling . \\n this code is concentrated in one c++ class named scheduler that provides member functions for the creation of the dependent task schedule and for the execution of the schedule . \\n the creation of the task schedule is performed during the creation of the neighbor lists when the particles have been binned into the cell grid . \\n the scheduler then checks if the cell grid has changed and runs the backward wave algorithm if necessary . \\n since the schedule depends only on the cell grid , there is no need to recreate it after every execution .    in order to execute the task schedule \\n , a functor object is passed to the scheduler . \\n the scheduler then uses the execution algorithm described in sec . \\n [ secwave ] to submit tasks to the tbb for execution . \\n whenever the tbb starts a task , the functor object is invoked to perform the actual work of the task . \\n the functor thus acts as a delegate and makes it possible to perform different operations like force calculation or neighbor list generation with the same schedule . \\n in contrast to a simple function pointer , the functor can pass additional information to the task . \\n for example , in a replica style simulation where multiple copies of the system are simulated simultaneously the functor might carry the information on which system copy the task should operate . \\n if the program is run with a single thread , a special version of the scheduler is created . \\n this serial scheduler skips the generation of the task schedule and does not use the tbb . \\n other changes concern mainly the force - calculation and neighbor - list generation . in the force calculation \\n the loops over all particles had to be changed so that they run only over the particles in one grid cell . \\n in addition to this the original c code was moved to a c++ class so that the scheduler could invoke it . \\n some care was required to create thread local storage for accumulated quantities like the potential energy . \\n finally , the code for the integration of the equations of motion was modified to use a thread - based parallelization .    as mentioned in sec . \\n [ sectask ] , a problem created by the parallel generation of the neighbor lists is the simultaneous update of the lists by multiple tasks . in order to avoid such conflicts , the current implementation stores the neighbor lists of each task separately . to this end \\n , the data structure of each task contains a c++ template std::vector@xmath7 . \\n the usage of automatic memory management might incur some overhead in terms of both memory and speed . \\n the experience with the code so far indicates , however , that the impact is small .        for large systems with a substantial amount of empty volumes \\n a large number of grid cells may be empty . instead of scheduling a task for these cells \\n , it makes sense to check for empty tasks during the generation of the task schedule and skip empty cells altogether . \\n this may lead to a substantial reduction of the data structures and the scheduling overhead . \\n the drawback of this optimization is that the task schedule must be regenerated every time that the linked - cell algorithm has run since particles might have moved into a previously empty cell . without empty - task skipping , the task schedule needs only to be regenerated if the number of grid cells changes . for systems that have a low number of empty cells \\n it is therefore more efficient not to skip the empty cells and to save the overhead of the repeated schedule generation instead .      another way to reduce the number of empty tasks and the number of tasks to be scheduled is to group a small block of @xmath8 grid cells into a single cell task . \\n this corresponds to an enlargement of the grid cells by an integer factor for the purpose of task scheduling ( the grid cells are still generated in the usual way so that the generation of neighbor lists is unaffected by this optimization ) . \\n cell task blocking is a double edged sword . on the one hand \\n , the reduction of the number of tasks through the blocking can reduce the scheduling overhead . \\n in addition to this cache performance improves as long as all particles affected by a task fit into the cache memory .    on the other hand , \\n both advantages turn into disadvantages for larger cell blocks . \\n the thread scheduler requires a large number of short tasks in order to obtain a good load balance , and the cache performance will decrease if the amount of memory used by the blocked task exceeds the size of the cache . for these reasons \\n task blocking should be used with care . \\n benchmark tests are recommended in order to find the optimal block size for a system .      in many cases , the definition of overlapping tasks given in sec . \\n [ sectask ] is actually unnecessarily restrictive . \\n if newton s third law is exploited by a simulation program , neighbor lists are usually constructed in such a way that pairs of particles are accounted for only once . if particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 are within the cutoff radius , @xmath9 will appear in the neighbor list of @xmath10 or @xmath10 will be in the neighbor list of @xmath9 but not both . \\n this is typically achieved by limiting the search for neighbors of a particle to 14 out of the 27 surrounding cells . \\n if the construction of neighbor lists excludes some of the surrounding cells , these cells can also be excluded from the definition of overlapping tasks as there is no risk of simultaneous particle updates in these cells . \\n a reduction of the overlap area of the tasks could be exploited to place more tasks in a wave , which increases the number of tasks that can run simultaneously . \\n while it is difficult to exploit the exact arrangements of the 14 cells used for the neighbor lists , it is easily possible to reduce the size of the overlap area from 27 to @xmath11 cells . \\n this would increase the number of tasks in a wave by up to 50% . \\n the current implementation of the cell task method does not employ a stricter definition of the task overlap - area for two reasons : first , there are actually potentials that access all 27 cells that surround an atom even if newton s third law is applied . \\n an example for this are the forces generated by the screening factor in the modified embedded - atom method @xcite . \\n second , this optimizations requires a tighter coupling between the neighbor list generation and the wave algorithm . \\n the optimization will , however , most likely be included in a future version of the code . \\n in order to test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm a series of benchmark tests involving four different configurations were carried out . \\n the configurations are a cubic block of fcc bulk copper ( 1,000,188 atoms ) , a spherical copper nanoparticle with a diameter of 30 nm ( 1,177,151 atoms ) , a porous system of partially sintered copper nanoparticles ( 1,992,220 atoms ) and two sintered copper nanoparticles ( 57,482 atoms ) . \\n these configurations are very different in terms of there homogeneity and the challenge they pose for the spatial decomposition method . \\n all simulations used the tight - binding second - moment potential for copper by cleri and rosato @xcite . \\n the structure of this potential is very similar to other many - body potentials of the embedded - atom method @xcite or finnis - sinclair @xcite type . \\n compared to other potentials the cleri and rosato potentials use rather simple functions , and the calculation of the forces with these potentials is therefore very fast . due to the low computational complexity , memory access speed can become a limiting factor in simulations with these potentials . \\n simulations of the three larger systems ( the small system ) were run over a period of 100 ( 2500 ) simulation steps . \\n all simulations regenerated the neighbor lists at every 10th step . \\n execution times were calculated as the average run time of five independent simulations excluding the time for initialization of the simulation and the loading or saving of the configuration . \\n the benchmark simulations were run on two different computers . \\n the first was a typical dual hex - core server with intel xeon x5650 processors and 16 gb ddr3 - 1333 ram . on this multi - core machine the original serial version of , the mpi based spatial decomposition version using 2 to 12 mpi ranks and \\n the new task - based version using 1 to 12 threads were tested . \\n the second test system was a xeon phi coprocessor 5110p @xcite . \\n only the task - based version of the program was employed on this machine , running the code in native mode with 1 to 240 threads .    the simulations with the task - based method used task blocking with a block size of @xmath12 for the three large systems and a block size of @xmath13 for the small system . \\n empty task skipping was used except for the simulations of bulk copper . \\n simulations with the mpi version employed @xmath14 and @xmath15 decompositions where possible in order to obtain the most compact subvolumes . for the compact bulk system \\n the impact of the details of the decomposition is very small . for the inhomogeneous systems the execution times certainly depend on the decomposition . \\n the general picture , however , can be expected to remain the same . \\n no attempt was therefore made to optimize the decomposition of these systems . \\n no direct comparison of the execution times of the program versions is attempted in the following . \\n the execution times @xmath16 of the task - based version running with @xmath17 threads are without exception lower than the corresponding times @xmath18 of the mpi version running with @xmath17 ranks or the execution time @xmath19 of the original serial program . \\n however the performance gains of the cell task versions are partly due to code changes when the force calculation was moved into a c++ class . \\n comparisons of the execution times or calculation of the speedup with respect to the fastest serial time [ which is @xmath20 would therefore make little sense .    in order to compare the cell task algorithm with spatial decomposition , the speedup of these algorithms with respect to the serial version that uses the same force calculation is used . \\n the speedups of the mpi and cell task version are thus calculated as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . \\n this definition eliminates the differences of the force calculation from the results and allows a fair comparison of the merits of both parallelization methods . \\n the crystalline bulk copper configuration is an example for a perfectly homogeneous system for which the spatial decomposition method works well . \\n figure  [ figbulk ] shows the parallel speedups obtained by the cell task method and spatial decomposition for this system on the multi - core machine . \\n as expected , spatial decomposition yields excellent parallel efficiencies ( speedup per processor or thread ) above 80% for almost all numbers of processors . \\n there are , however , dips in the curve at 5 , 10 , and 11 processors . \\n the reason for this is that for these numbers the regular crystal lattice of the system can not be divided evenly among the processors . \\n this emphasizes another disadvantage of spatial decomposition : the efficiency of the method depends on details of the system , and not all numbers of processors work equally well . \\n the cell task method , on the other hand , delivers much more consistent speedup factors that increase monotonously with the number of threads . with the exception of the cases of 5 , 10 , and 11 processors which have already been discussed , both methods obtain similar speedups . \\n according to the figure the cell task method might have a slight advantage , but this should not be overemphasized as this might be a result of the differences in the force calculation code . \\n for the bulk system , the cell task method obtains a parallel efficiency of 83.6% when using 12 threads . \\n one might ask whether for a system with more than one million atoms this value should not be higher since for a system of this size the fraction of time spent in serial code can be expected to be negligible . while some overhead is certainly caused by the dynamic scheduling of the tasks \\n the principal factor limiting parallel efficiency is memory access speed . \\n a short test on a system with a lower clock frequency but faster memory resulted in a higher parallel efficiency of 90.2% for 12 threads . \\n in addition to this , the fact that the spatial decomposition program achieves similar speedups indicates that the parallel efficiency is limited by hardware constraints rather than the algorithms . \\n the spherical nanoparticle system is inhomogeneous in the sense that the particle fills only a part of the volume of the simulation box leaving the rest empty . for the spatial decomposition method this configuration is challenging since there is no simple way to divide the simulation box into an arbitrary number of domains with equal shapes so that each domain contains a similar number of particles . \\n exceptions are the cases of two , four and eight processors where equal partitions can be obtained by cutting the sphere repeatedly into halves . \\n this is confirmed by the speedup factors obtained on the multi - core machine for this system ( see fig . \\n [ figsphere ] ) . spatial decomposition in this system \\n is efficient only for two , four and eight processors . in all other cases \\n the parallel efficiency is significantly lower in the range of 50% - 60% . \\n in contrast to this , the cell task method yields efficiencies above 80% for all numbers of threads . \\n the parallel efficiency of the cell task method for this system is 82.8% when using 12 threads , very similar to the value obtained for the bulk system . \\n the partially sintered nanocrystalline copper system is the most complex and inhomogenous of the three benchmark systems ( see fig .  [ figcubocfg ] ) . \\n the configuration is an intermediate result from a simulation of the coalescence of an ensemble of copper nanoparticles . as can be seen from fig . \\n [ figcubocfg ] the system is very inhomogeneous with an irregular distribution of the atoms and a large amount of empty space . \\n the work presented in this article was motivated by systems like this . \\n figure  [ figcubo ] shows the speedup factors obtained for the nanocrystalline configuration on the multi - core machine . \\n it is clear from this figure that spatial decomposition is not very effective for this kind of system . \\n while the speedup factors increase more or less monotonously , they are far below the ideal value of one per processor . \\n the reason for this is clear from fig . \\n [ figcubocfg ] . only by great chance \\n could a regular subdivision of the system into domains result in a balanced workload . \\n the cell task method , on the other hand , has no particular problems with the porous nature of this system . \\n the speedups shown in fig . \\n [ figcubo ] for the cell task method are very similar to those obtained for the two previous benchmark systems . with 80.9% \\n the parallel efficiency of the cell task method for this system when using 12 threads is slightly lower than for the previous two systems . \\n this can probably be explained by the large surface of the configuration which reduces the average number of neighbors per particle significantly . the lower number of neighbors in turn affects the memory access pattern and might reduce cache efficiency .          in order to test the efficiency of the cell task method for smaller configurations , a system consisting of two sintered copper nanoparticles with only 57,482 atoms \\n was used . fig . \\n [ figsys08cfg ] shows the dumbbell - like shape of the system , which constitutes a similar challenge to spatial decomposition as the spherical nanoparticle .        on the multi - core machine , \\n the behavior of the speedup factor in this benchmark is similar to the nanoparticle system ( see fig . \\n [ figsys08 ] ) . \\n the speedup of the cell task method increases continuously with the number of threads . \\n the speedups for the spatial decomposition method are generally inferior to those obtained by the cell task method except for @xmath23 2 , 4 and 8 where the symmetry of the configuration allows an efficient decomposition .    the main difference between the speedups of the cell task method shown in fig . \\n [ figsys08 ] and the other benchmark systems is a slight overall reduction of the cell task method s parallel efficiency . when using 12 threads , the efficiency obtained for this system is only 77.3% . \\n the reason for this reduction is most likely the growing impact of serial code . \\n the benchmark results presented in the preceding sections demonstrate the efficiency of the cell task method on typical multi - core machines . in this section the efficiency of the method on a many - core system \\n is studied . \\n the intel xeon phi coprocessors 5110p integrates 60 compute cores on a single chip and provides a large memory bandwidth . \\n each core supports four hardware threads and has 512-bit vector registers that allow the simultaneous execution of eight double - precision floating - point operations . under normal conditions , \\n optimal performance can be achieved only if at least two threads are running on each core . \\n for a detailed discussion of these devices the reader is referred to ref . \\n @xcite . \\n figure  [ figmic ] shows the parallel speedups obtained with the four benchmark systems used in this work on the xeon phi coprocessor using up to 240 threads . \\n interestingly , the behavior of all four systems is different .    until @xmath24 threads , \\n the speedups for the three large systems stay close to the line of ideal speedup . at @xmath24 , \\n the speedup of the three systems range from @xmath25 ( cf . \\n table  [ tabmic ] ) , corresponding to parallel efficiencies between 83.4% and 90.8% . at this point , \\n the three curves exhibit a sharp bend but the speedup continues to rise at a lower rate until @xmath26 . \\n this is due to the fact that now more than one thread is running per core . \\n although the xeon phi microarchitecture requires more than one thread per core for optimal performance , it is not guaranteed that the performance will be doubled by a second thread . \\n the threads share after all some of the physical units of the core like level 1 and 2 caches . \\n a likely reason for the slower increase of the speedup for @xmath17 in the range from 60 to 120 is an increased amount of cache misses . \\n beyond @xmath26 the speedup curves of the three large benchmark systems show a more or less pronounced dip ( hardly noticeable for the porous nanocrystalline system and most visible in case of the nanoparticle ) after which the speedup continues to rise . \\n the reason for this dip is not yet understood . \\n the bulk system and the porous nanocrystalline system reach their maximum speedup at @xmath27 after which the speedup decreases for both systems . \\n in contrast to this , the nanoparticle simulation increases its speedup until @xmath28 .    compared to the larger benchmark systems , simulations of the sintered nanoparticles achieve significantly lower speedups on the xeon phi . \\n the speedup curve for this system deviates early on from the ideal behavior and it reaches a plateau around @xmath29 . for larger values of @xmath17 \\n the curve decreases with clear steps at @xmath26 and @xmath27 \\n . the lower performance of the xeon phi in this benchmark can be explained by the system size . \\n the small volume of the configuration does not allow for more than about 100 tasks to be run simultaneously . \\n adding more threads can therefore not accelerate the computations . \\n the decrease of the efficiency for larger values of @xmath17 is probably caused by increased management overhead when the internal task queues run empty . \\n a similar effect might be the reason for the efficiency decrease in case of the bulk system beyond @xmath27 .    . \\n speedup of benchmarks systems on the xeon phi coprocessor : number of threads @xmath30 for which the maximum speedup was obtained together with the corresponding speedup @xmath31 , and the speedup for 60 threads @xmath32 and maximum speedup @xmath33 with respect to the 12-core test machine . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tabmic ] summarizes the maximum speedups obtained for the four benchmark systems on the xeon phi coprocessor . \\n the best speedups above 90 are achieved by the bulk system and the nanoparticle . \\n the porous nanocrystalline system reaches a maximum speedup of 75 , whereas the small system of two sintered nanoparticles is limited to @xmath34 . \\n the table also gives the speedup of the systems on the coprocessor with respect to single thread execution on the 12 core machine . \\n these values are not overly impressive . \\n one has to keep in mind , however , that the individual cores of the coprocessor are considerably less powerful than a modern general purpose cpu . as pointed out in ref . \\n @xcite , the key to a strong performance of the xeon phi coprocessor is a highly parallel algorithm combined with vectorization . in this work only the first part has been addressed . \\n this article describes the design of a parallel algorithm for md simulations with short - ranged forces on single node multi- and many - core systems . \\n the aim of the cell task algorithm is to provide an efficient parallelization method for systems where spatial decomposition is not effective . \\n examples for such problematic cases are large inhomogeneous systems like nanostructured materials or nanodevices . \\n the cell task method makes use of the linked - cell technique to subdivide the force calculation into small tasks . \\n the tasks are then executed by a team of threads according to a dependent task schedule . \\n this schedule is an important part of the algorithm . \\n it avoids the situation that a particle is accessed by two threads simultaneously . \\n this effectively eliminates the need for synchronization constructs in the force calculation , which makes the algorithm very efficient . \\n benchmark simulations on a 12-core system show clearly that for inhomogeneous configurations like nanoparticles or porous systems the cell task method performs significantly better than spatial decomposition . for a homogeneous crystalline bulk system \\n both methods achieve comparable speedups . \\n an added advantage of the cell task method is its consistent performance . \\n the speedup factor of this method increases continuously with the number of threads in a very similar manner for all types of systems . \\n it relieves the user from technical considerations like which spatial decomposition strategy works best for a given system . \\n the benchmarks on the multi - core system reveal two factors that limit the parallel efficiency of the cell task method : memory access speed and small system size . \\n neither of these factors is specific to the cell task method . \\n no parallelization strategy will work if the memory system can not deliver the data fast enough , and every md program contains inevitably some serial code that limits the parallel efficiency . \\n note , however , that in the current implementation of the cell task method the construction of the task schedule increases the fraction of time spent in serial code slightly as the wave algorithm has not been parallelized yet . \\n execution of the benchmark simulations on a 60 core intel xeon phi coprocessor shows that the cell task method scales to large numbers of threads . for large configurations the speedup increases linearly and close to the ideal line until @xmath24 . beyond 60 threads , the speedups increase at a lower rate since \\n the number of threads per core is now greater than one . \\n running more than one thread per core is almost always beneficial on the xeon phi since it hides latencies of the microarchitecture  @xcite . \\n table  [ tabmic ] shows that the three larger benchmark systems reach their maximum speedups on the xeon phi at three or four threads per core . \\n these maximum speedups @xmath31 range from 75 to 93 and they are 44% to 86% higher than the speedups @xmath32 obtained at one thread per core \\n .    the smallest benchmark system does not perform optimally on the xeon phi coprocessor . \\n the reason for this is that the configuration is not large enough to keep two or more threads per core busy . \\n the dependent task schedule limits the number of tasks that can run simultaneously to at most 1/27 of the total number of tasks . in order to keep all threads running , the number of tasks must therefore be at least 27 times the number of threads . in practice optimal performance \\n might require an even substantially larger number of tasks per thread . \\n more work will be necessary to study the performance limits of the algorithm for smaller systems . \\n all benchmarks shown in this work used the copper potential by cleri and rosato  @xcite . \\n this choice might have limited the parallel efficiency due to the low computational complexity of the potential which emphasizes memory access issues . \\n it would be interesting to see the performance of the cell task algorithm with a computationally more demanding potential like , for example , one of the eam potentials in ref . \\n with such a potential higher parallel efficiencies closer to the ideal limit can be expected since the influence of memory access speed and serial code execution would be diminished . \\n work is currently in progress to let the program take advantage of the vector capabilities of the xeon phi architecture . \\n in addition to this it is planned to extend the method into a hybrid scheme for distributed systems that combines the cell task algorithm for the parallelization on the compute nodes with spatial decomposition to share the work between multiple nodes . \\n this work has been supported financially by laurentian university and the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) . \\n generous allocation of computer time on the facilities of the shared hierarchical academic research network ( sharcnet )  @xcite and compute / calcul canada is gratefully acknowledged . \\n the wave algorithm generates the dependent task schedule for the cell task method from a series of sets of non - overlapping tasks ( _ waves _ ) . \\n this appendix gives details about the construction of the waves . \\n the indices of the cells belonging to one wave are generated from the cartesian product of three sets of integers ( one for each dimension ) . to give a two - dimensional example , the wave shown in fig . \\n [ figwave ] could be constructed from the product @xmath35 [ we assume here and in the following that the cell in the lower left corner has the indices ( 1,1 ) ] . \\n the product @xmath36 would generate a similar wave with the tasks shifted one cell to the right . \\n note that not all index sets can be used to generate a wave . in order to obtain non - overlapping task \\n , the differences between all indices in a set must be at least three ( subject to the boundary condition of that dimension ; for a dimension with @xmath37 cells and periodic boundary conditions , the difference between index 1 and @xmath37 is 1 ) . \\n the product @xmath38 , for example , does not give a valid wave . \\n the number of index sets necessary to cover all cells in one dimension depends on two factors . \\n if the number of cells @xmath37 in that dimension is a multiple of three or if periodic boundary conditions do not apply in that direction , three index sets are enough . \\n these three sets start with the numbers 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , and advance in steps of three to the end of the system . \\n for example , all cells of a non - periodic system with @xmath39 are covered by the following three sets : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . \\n this coverage of the cells in one dimension is shown by the following figure where the numbers indicate to which wave the cell belongs . \\n @xmath43 it is easy to see that the cells belonging to the same wave are separated by at least two cells not belonging to that wave . \\n things are more complicated for directions where periodic boundary conditions apply and where @xmath37 is not a multiple of three . in this case \\n a fourth index set is required . \\n the index sets for such a case can be obtained by advancing continuously in steps of three , wrapping around at the boundary @xmath37 . for a periodic system with @xmath39 , \\n the first set is then @xmath44 . unlike the non - periodic case , @xmath45 \\n can not be included in this set as that cell overlaps with the first . by advancing in steps of three \\n we obtain the second set @xmath46 . \\n advancing further in steps of three we obtain for the third and fourth sets @xmath47 and @xmath48 . \\n the coverage of the cells in this case is thus @xmath49    a complete set of waves in more than one dimension can be generated by nested loops where each loop generates the index sets for one dimension . in order to keep the number of dependencies between tasks low , \\n it is best if from one wave to the next , the task pattern is shifted only in one direction . \\n this is achieved if the inner loops are not reset when one of the outer loops advances . instead \\n , the inner loops repeat their last pattern , possibly filling it to the maximum number of cells . \\n this is explained by the next figure , which shows the first six waves in a periodic system with @xmath50 cells : @xmath51    the first four waves use the same index set @xmath52 for the @xmath53 direction and thus essentially repeat the one - dimensional example given above . when going from the fourth to the fifth wave , the index set for the @xmath54 direction does not return to the set of the first wave . \\n instead the set reuses the indices from the fourth wave @xmath55 and completes the set by advancing in steps of three which leads to leads to the set @xmath56 . \\n the sixth set is then generated by further advances in steps of three as described above .    since each dimension \\n is covered by three or four sets of indices , the total number of waves for a system with @xmath57 dimensions is given by a product of @xmath57 factors where each factor is 3 or 4 depending on the dimensions of the cell grid and the boundary conditions . in three dimensions \\n the total number of waves is thus 27 , 36 , 48 , or 64 . \\n 27ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1\\'\\'\\'\\'@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \\n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop _ \\n ( ,  ,  ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ,  ) @noop _ _ ,  ed . \\n ( ,  , ) @noop _ _ ,  ed . \\n ( ,  ) @noop \\n * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop @noop _ _  ( ,  ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) in  https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpar11/tech/final_files/vandierendonck.pdf[__ ]  ( ,  ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop @noop ph.d . thesis ,  , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _ ,  ed . \\n ( , ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop', 'this article introduces a highly parallel algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations with short -

bromm & larson 2004 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; miralda - escud 2003 ) . \\n currently , we can directly probe the state of the universe roughly a million years after the big bang by detecting the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , thus providing us with the initial conditions for subsequent structure formation . \\n complementary to the cmb observations , we can probe cosmic history all the way from the present - day universe to roughly a billion years after the big bang , using the best available ground- and space - based telescopes . in between lies the remaining frontier , and the first stars and galaxies are the sign - posts of this early , formative epoch . \\n to simulate the build - up of the first stellar systems , we have to address the feedback from the very first stars on the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and the formation of the second generation of stars out of material that was influenced by this feedback . \\n there are a number of reasons why addressing the feedback from the first stars and understanding second - generation star formation is crucial : + _ \\n ( i ) _ the first steps in the hierarchical build - up of structure provide us with a simplified laboratory for studying galaxy formation , which is one of the main outstanding problems in cosmology . + _ \\n ( ii ) _ the initial burst of pop  iii star formation may have been rather brief due to the strong negative feedback effects that likely acted to self - limit this formation mode ( greif & bromm 2006 ; yoshida et al . \\n second - generation star formation , therefore , might well have been cosmologically dominant compared to pop  iii stars . + _ ( iii ) _ a subset of second - generation stars , those with masses below @xmath1 , would have survived to the present day . \\n surveys of extremely metal - poor galactic halo stars therefore provide an indirect window into the pop  iii era by scrutinizing their chemical abundance patterns , which reflect the enrichment from a single , or at most a small multiple of , pop  iii sne ( beers & christlieb 2005 ; frebel et al . \\n stellar archaeology thus provides unique empirical constraints for numerical simulations , from which one can derive theoretical abundance patterns to be compared with the data .    existing and planned observatories , such as hst , keck , vlt , and the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ , planned for launch around 2013 , \\n yield data on stars and quasars less than a billion years after the big bang . \\n the ongoing _ swift _ gamma - ray burst ( grb ) mission provides us with a possible window into massive star formation at the highest redshifts ( bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ) . measurements of the near - ir cosmic background radiation , both in terms of the spectral energy distribution and the angular fluctuations provide additional constraints on the overall energy production due to the first stars ( dwek et al . \\n 2005 ; fernandez & komatsu 2006 ; kashlinsky et al . \\n 2005 ; magliocchetti et al . 2003 ; \\n santos et al . 2002 ) . understanding the formation of the first galaxies is thus of great interest to observational studies conducted both at high redshifts and in our local galactic neighborhood .    , in primordial gas which cools in four distinct situations . \\n the solid line corresponds to gas with an initial density of @xmath2 , which is compressed and heated by a sn shock with velocity @xmath3 at @xmath4 . \\n the dotted line corresponds to gas at an initial density of @xmath5 shocked during the formation of a @xmath6 halo at @xmath7 . \\n the dashed line corresponds to unshocked , un - ionized primordial gas with an initial density of @xmath8 collapsing inside a minihalo at @xmath4 . \\n finally , the dash - dotted line shows the hd fraction in primordial gas collapsing from an initial density of @xmath8 inside a relic h  ii region at @xmath4 . \\n the horizontal line at the top denotes the cosmic abundance of deuterium . \\n primordial gas with an hd abundance above the critical value , @xmath9 , denoted by the bold dashed line , can cool to the cmb temperature within a hubble time . ] \\n the first stars in the universe likely formed roughly 150 myr after the big bang , when the primordial gas was first able to cool and collapse into dark matter minihalos with masses of the order of 10@xmath10 @xmath11 ( bromm et al . \\n 1999 , 2002 ; abel et al . \\n these stars are believed to have been very massive , with masses of the order of 100 @xmath11 , owing to the limited cooling properties of primordial gas , which could only cool in minihalos through the radiation from h@xmath12 molecules . while the initial conditions for the formation of these stars are , in principle , known from precision measurements of cosmological parameters ( e.g. spergel et al . \\n 2007 ) , pop  iii star formation may have occurred in different environments which may allow for different modes of star formation . \\n indeed , it has become evident that pop  iii star formation might actually consist of two distinct modes : one where the primordial gas collapses into a dm minihalo ( see below ) , and one where the metal - free gas becomes significantly ionized prior to the onset of gravitational runaway collapse ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) . \\n we had termed this latter mode of primordial star formation ` pop  ii.5 ' ( greif & bromm 2006 ; johnson & bromm 2006 ; mackey et al . \\n to more clearly indicate that both modes pertain to _ metal - free _ star formation , we here follow the new classification scheme suggested by chris mckee ( see mckee & tan 2007 ; johnson et al . 2008 ) . within this scheme , the minihalo pop  iii mode \\n is now termed pop  iii.1 , whereas the second mode ( formerly ` pop  ii.5 ' ) is now called pop  iii.2 . \\n the hope is that mckee s terminology will gain wide acceptance .    . \\n pop  ii stars , formed in gas which is enriched with metals , emerged at lower redshifts and have characteristic masses of the order of @xmath13 . \\n pop  iii.2 stars , formed from ionized primordial gas , have characteristic masses reflecting the fact that they form from gas that has cooled to the temperature of the cmb . \\n thus , the characteristic mass of pop  iii.2 stars is a function of redshift , but is typically of the order of @xmath14 . ]    while the very first pop  iii stars ( so - called pop iii.1 ) , with masses of the order of @xmath15 , formed within dm minihalos in which primordial gas cools by h@xmath12 molecules alone , the hd molecule can play an important role in the cooling of primordial gas in several situations , allowing the temperature to drop well below @xmath16 ( abel et al . \\n 2002 ; bromm et al . \\n 2002 ) . in turn \\n , this efficient cooling may lead to the formation of primordial stars with masses of the order of @xmath14 ( so - called pop iii.2 ) ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) . \\n in general , the formation of hd , and the concomitant cooling that it provides , is found to occur efficiently in primordial gas which is strongly ionized , owing ultimately to the high abundance of electrons which serve as catalyst for molecule formation in the early universe ( shapiro & kang 1987 ) . \\n efficient cooling by hd can be triggered within the relic h  ii regions that surround pop  iii.1 stars at the end of their brief lifetimes , owing to the high electron fraction that persists in the gas as it cools and recombines ( johnson et al . \\n 2007 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ; yoshida et al . \\n the efficient formation of hd can also take place when the primordial gas is collisionally ionized , such as behind the shocks driven by the first sne or in the virialization of massive dm halos ( greif & bromm 2006 ; johnson & bromm 2006 ; machida et al . 2005 ; shchekinov & vasiliev 2006 ) . in figure  1 , we show the hd fraction in primordial gas in four distinct situations : within a minihalo in which the gas is never strongly ionized , behind a @xmath17 shock wave driven by a sn , in the virialization of a @xmath6 dm halo at redshift @xmath7 , and in the relic h  ii region generated by a pop  iii.1 star at @xmath18 ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) . also shown is the critical hd fraction necessary to allow the primordial gas to cool to the temperature floor set by the cmb at these redshifts . except for the situation of the gas in the virtually un - ionized minihalo , the fraction of hd becomes large quickly enough to play an important role in the cooling of the gas , allowing the formation of pop  iii.2 stars .     and \\n hd molecules . the light and dark shades of blue denote regions with a free electron fraction of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , while the shades of green denote regions with an h@xmath12 fraction of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , in order of decreasing brightness . \\n the regions with the highest molecule abundances lie within relic h  ii regions , which thus play an important role in subsequent star formation , allowing molecules to become shielded from photodissociating radiation and altering the cooling properties of the primordial gas . ] \\n figure  2 schematically shows the characteristic masses of the various stellar populations that form in the early universe . in the wake of pop  iii.1 stars formed in dm minihalos , pop  iii.2 star formation \\n ensues in regions which have been previously ionized , typically associated with relic h  ii regions left over from massive pop  iii.1 stars collapsing to black holes , while even later , when the primordial gas is locally enriched with metals , pop  ii stars begin to form ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; greif & bromm 2006 ) . \\n recent simulations confirm this picture , as pop  iii.2 star formation ensues in relic h  ii regions in well under a hubble time , while the formation of pop  ii stars after the first sn explosions is delayed by more than a hubble time ( greif et al . 2007 ; yoshida et al . 2007a , b ; but see whalen et al . \\n due to their extreme mass scale , pop  iii.1 stars emit copious amounts of ionizing radiation , as well as a strong flux of h@xmath12-dissociating lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation ( bromm et al . 2001b ; schaerer 2002 ) . \\n thus , the radiation from the first stars dramatically influences their surroundings , heating and ionizing the gas within a few kpc ( physical ) around the progenitor , and destroying the h@xmath12 and hd molecules locally within somewhat larger regions ( alvarez et al . \\n 2006 ; abel et al . 2007 ; ferrara 1998 ; johnson et al . 2007 ; kitayama et al . 2004 \\n ; whalen et al . 2004 ) . additionally , the lw radiation emitted by the first stars could propagate across cosmological distances , allowing the build - up of a pervasive lw background radiation field ( haiman et al . \\n 2000 ) . \\n the impact of radiation from the first stars on their local surroundings has important implications for the numbers and types of pop  iii stars that form . \\n the photoheating of gas in the minihalos hosting pop  iii.1 stars drives strong outflows , lowering the density of the primordial gas and delaying subsequent star formation by up to @xmath24 ( johnson et al . \\n 2007 ; whalen et al . 2004 ; yoshida et al . \\n furthermore , neighboring minihalos may be photoevaporated , delaying star formation in such systems as well ( ahn & shapiro 2007 ; greif et al . 2007 \\n ; shapiro et al . 2004 ; susa & umemura 2006 ; whalen et al . 2007 ) . \\n the photodissociation of molecules by lw photons emitted from local star - forming regions will , in general , act to delay star formation by destroying the main coolants that allow the gas to collapse and form stars . \\n , while the plus signs denote the optical depth averaged over a cube of @xmath25 ( comoving ) per side , centered on the middle of the box . \\n the solid line denotes the average optical depth that would be expected for a constant h@xmath12 fraction of @xmath26 ( primordial gas ) , which changes only due to cosmic expansion . ] \\n the photoionization of primordial gas , however , can ultimately lead to the production of copious amounts of molecules within the relic h  ii regions surrounding the remnants of pop  iii.1 stars ( johnson & bromm 2007 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ; oh & haiman 2002 ; ricotti et al . 2001 ) . \\n recent simulations tracking the formation of , and radiative feedback from , individual pop  iii.1 stars in the early stages of the assembly of the first galaxies have demonstrated that the accumulation of relic h  ii regions has two important effects . \\n first , the hd abundance that develops in relic h  ii regions allows the primordial gas to re - collapse and cool to the temperature of the cmb , possibly leading to the formation of pop  iii.2 stars in these regions ( johnson et al . \\n 2007 ; yoshida et al . \\n second , the molecule abundance in relic h  ii regions , along with their increasing volume - filling fraction , leads to a large optical depth to lw photons over physical distances of the order of several kpc . \\n the development of a high optical depth to lw photons over such short length - scales suggests that the optical depth to lw photons over cosmological scales may be very high , acting to suppress the build - up of a background lw radiation field , and mitigating negative feedback on star formation . \\n figure  3 shows the chemical composition of primordial gas in relic h  ii regions , in which the formation of h@xmath12 molecules is catalyzed by the high residual electron fraction . \\n figure  4 shows the average optical depth to lw photons across the simulation box , which rises with time owing to the increasing number of relic h  ii regions . \\n , is generated for the case that every minihalo with a virial temperature @xmath27 2 @xmath28 10@xmath29 k hosts a pop iii star , without the lw background in turn diminishing the sfr , labeled here as sfr@xmath30 . \\n the self - regulated model considers the coupling between the star formation rate , sfr@xmath31 , and the critical lw background that it produces , @xmath32 . \\n the minimum value for the lw background , @xmath33 , is produced for the case of a high opacity through the relic h  ii regions left by the first stars , in which case the self - consistent sfr , sfr@xmath34 can approach the undiminished sfr@xmath30 . ]      while the reionization of the universe is likely to have occurred at later times , as inferred from the _ wmap _ third year results ( spergel et al . \\n 2007 ) , the process of primordial star formation can be affected by the build up of a lw background very soon after the formation of the first stars . \\n this lw radiation , which acts to destroy h@xmath12 , the very coolant that enables the formation of the first stars , can , in principle , dramatically lower the formation rate of pop iii stars in minihalos ( e.g. haiman et al . \\n 2000 ;

( 2008 ) argue that there is a critical value for the lw flux , @xmath32 @xmath36 0.04 , at which pop iii.1 star formation occurs self - consistently , with the implication that the popiii.1 star formation rate in minihalos at @xmath35 @xmath37 15 is decreased by only a factor of a few , as shown in fig . \\n the star formation rate may be even higher if the cosmological average optical depth to lw photons through the relic h  ii regions left by the first stars is sufficiently high . \\n an analytical model of this effect shows that the sfr may be only negligibly reduced once the volume - filling factor of relic h  ii regions becomes large , as is also shown in fig . \\n 5 ( johnson et al . 2008 ) . \\n simulations of the formation of a dwarf galaxy at @xmath35 @xmath27 10 which take into account the effect of a lw background at @xmath32 show that pop iii.1 star formation takes place before the galaxy is fully assembled , suggesting that the formation of metal - free galaxies may be a rare event in the early universe ( johnson et al . \\n figure 6 shows the temperature and density of the protogalaxy simulated by these authors at @xmath38 . \\n @xmath36 12.5 . \\n the panels show the inner @xmath39 10.6 kpc ( physical ) of our cosmological box . \\n the cluster of minihaloes harboring dense gas just left of the center in each panel is the site of the formation of the two pop iii.1 stars which are able to form in our simulation including the effects of the self - regulated lw background . \\n the remaining minihaloes are not able to form stars by this redshift , largely due to the photodissociation of the coolant h@xmath12 . \\n the main progenitor dm halo , which hosts the first star at @xmath35 @xmath36 16 , by @xmath35 @xmath36 12.5 has accumulated a mass of 9 @xmath28 10@xmath40 m@xmath41 through mergers and accretion . \\n note that the gas in this halo has been heated to temperatures above 10@xmath42 k , leading to a high free electron fraction and high molecule fractions in the collapsing gas . \\n the high hd fraction that is generated likely leads to the formation of pop iii.2 stars in this system . ] \\n recent numerical simulations have indicated that primordial stars forming in dm minihalos typically attain @xmath15 by efficient accretion , and might even become as massive as @xmath43 ( bromm & loeb 2004 ; oshea & norman 2007 ; omukai & palla 2003 ; yoshida et al . \\n 2006 ) . after their main - sequence lifetimes of typically @xmath44 \\n , stars with masses below @xmath45 are thought to collapse directly to black holes without significant metal ejection , while in the range @xmath46 a pair -

dimensional simulation to date took cosmological initial conditions into account , and followed the evolution of the gas until the formation of the first minihalo at @xmath56 ( greif et al . \\n 2007 ) . after the gas approached the ` loitering regime ' at @xmath57 , the formation of a primordial star was assumed , and a photoheating and ray - tracing algorithm determined the size and structure of the resulting h  ii region ( johnson et al . \\n an explosion energy of @xmath58 was then injected as thermal energy into a small region around the progenitor , and the subsequent expansion of the sn remnant was followed until the blast wave effectively dissolved into the igm . \\n the cooling mechanisms responsible for radiating away the energy of the sn remnant , the temporal behavior of the shock , and its morphology could thus be investigated in great detail ( see figure  7 ) . \\n , for metal -

mass stars . \\n however , this transition required at least a hubble time , since the presence of metals became important only after the sn remnant had stalled and the enriched gas re - collapsed to high densities ( greif et al . 2007 ; but see whalen et al . \\n furthermore , the metal distribution was highly anisotropic , as the post - shock gas expanded into the voids in the shape of an ` hour - glass ' , with a maximum extent similar to the final mass - weighted mean shock radius ( greif et al . 2007 ) .    to efficiently mix the metals with all components of the swept - up gas , a dm halo of at least @xmath59 had to be assembled ( greif et al . \\n 2007 ) , and with an initial yield of @xmath60 , the average metallicity of such a system would accumulate to @xmath61 , well above any critical metallicity ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; bromm et al . 2001a ; schneider et al . \\n 2006 ; see also wise & abel 2007 ) . \\n thus , if energetic sne were a common fate for the first stars , they would have deposited metals on large scales before massive galaxies formed and outflows were suppressed . \\n hints to such ubiquitous metal enrichment have been found in the low column density ly@xmath62 forest ( aguirre et al . \\n 2005 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ; songaila 2001 ) , and in dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way ( helmi et al . \\n the discovery of extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo has made studies of the chemical composition of low - mass pop  ii stars powerful probes of the conditions in which the first low - mass stars formed . while it is widely accepted that metals are required for the formation of low - mass stars , two general classes of competing models for the pop  iii \\n pop  ii transition are discussed in the literature : _ ( i ) _ atomic fine - structure line cooling ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; santoro & shull 2006 ) ; and _ ( ii ) _ dust - induced fragmentation ( schneider et al . \\n 2006 ) . within the fine - structure model , c  ii and o  i have been suggested as main coolants ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) , such that low - mass star formation can occur in gas that is enriched beyond critical abundances of @xmath63}_{\\\\rm{crit}}\\\\simeq -3.5\\\\pm 0.1 $ ] and @xmath64}_{\\\\rm{crit}}\\\\simeq -3\\\\pm 0.2 $ ] . \\n the dust - cooling model , on the other hand , predicts critical abundances that are typically smaller by a factor of @xmath65 . \\n based on the theory of atomic line cooling ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) , a new function , the ` transition discriminant ' has been introduced : @xmath66}}+0.3\\\\times 10^{\\\\mbox{[o / h]}}\\\\right)\\\\mbox{\\\\ , } \\\\ ] ] such that low - mass star formation requires @xmath67 ( frebel et al . \\n figure  8 shows values of @xmath68 for a large number of the most metal - poor stars available in the literature . while theories based on dust cooling can be pushed to accommodate the lack of stars with @xmath69 \\n , it appears that the atomic - cooling theory for the pop iii  pop ii transition naturally explains the existing data on metal - poor stars . \\n future surveys of galactic halo stars will allow to further populate plots such as figure  8 , and will provide valuable insight into the conditions of the early universe in which the first low - mass stars formed . \\n the abundance patterns observed in the most metal - poor stars can also provide information about the types of sn that ended the lives of the first stars , as the metals that are emitted in these explosions will become incorporated into later generations of stars , some of which are observed in the halo of the galaxy . \\n interestingly , while detailed numerical simulations of the formation of the first stars suggest that they were often massive enough to explode as pisn , no clear signature of such a pisn has yet been detected in a metal - poor star . \\n does this imply that the first stars did not explode as pisn , or that they were not very massive ( see also ekstrom in this proceedings ) ? \\n = -2 $ ] as a function of @xmath70 , corresponding to @xmath71 ( big blue dots ) , @xmath72 ( medium sized , blue dots ) , and @xmath73 ( small , dark blue dots ) pisn -

poor stars . therefore , one possible explanation for the apparent lack of pop iii pisne is that the few stars which might have formed from gas dominantly enriched by a pisn may have relatively high metallicities , and so may have eluded surveys seeking such true second generation stars at lower metallicity ( karlsson et al . \\n karlsson et al . \\n ( 2008 ) developed a model for the inhomogeneous chemical enrichment of the gas collapsing to become a dwarf galaxy at z @xmath36 10 in which the formation of both pop iii stars from metal - free gas and the formation of pop ii stars from metal - enriched gas were tracked self - consistently . \\n these authors find that the lack of the discovery of a metal - poor star showing signs of enrichment dominated by pisn yields in the existing catalog of metal poor stars is not inconsistent with theories predicting that the first stars were very massive , as shown in figure 9 . \\n it is hoped that future surveys of stars in the galactic halo will test this model by searching for pisn - enriched stars with metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath27 -2.5 . \\n understanding the formation of the first galaxies marks the frontier of high - redshift structure formation . \\n it is crucial to predict their properties in order to develop the optimal search and survey strategies for the _ jwst_. whereas _ ab - initio _ simulations of the very first stars can be carried out from first principles , and with virtually no free parameters , one faces a much more daunting challenge with the first galaxies . \\n now , the previous history of star formation has to be considered , leading to enhanced complexity in the assembly of the first galaxies . \\n one by one , all the complex astrophysical processes that play a role in more recent galaxy formation appear back on the scene . among them \\n are external radiation fields , comprising uv and x - ray photons , and possibly cosmic rays produced in the wake of the first sne ( stacy & bromm 2007 ) . \\n there will be metal - enriched pockets of gas which could be pervaded by dynamically non - negligible magnetic fields , together with turbulent velocity fields built up during the virialization process . \\n however , the goal of making useful predictions for the first galaxies is now clearly drawing within reach , and the pace of progress is likely to be rapid .\", 'the formation of the first generations of stars at redshifts @xmath0 signaled the transition from the simple initial state of the universe to one of ever increasing complexity . \\n we here review recent progress in understanding the assembly process of the first galaxies , starting with cosmological initial conditions and modelling the detailed physics of star formation . \\n in particular , we study the role of hd cooling in ionized primordial gas , the impact of uv radiation produced by the first stars , and the propagation of the supernova blast waves triggered at the end of their brief lives . \\n we conclude by discussing how the chemical abundance patterns observed in extremely low - metallicity stars allow us to probe the properties of the first stars .', 223, 5352, 128], [' formulae and discuss the spin transport along periodic orbits . in section [ sec3 ] we formulate the trace formula for the dirac equation in terms of periodic orbits . \\n we also discuss the rle of the spin transport in the trace formula the other phase is of the type of the dynamical phase of a magnetic moment . \\n the trace formula for the dirac equation is therefore similar to the trace formula for the scalar wave equation with the only difference that the spin contributions to the , respectively . \\n the corresponding classical hamiltonian matrices are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . \\n the amplitudes @xmath43 have to satisfy the transport equations @xmath54 which are obtained be calculated as follows . \\n first , we note that the trace of the operator @xmath102 is equal to the trace of the operator @xmath103 , which is defined by the functional calculus given by the spectral theorem . \\n therefore emphasize that the above mentioned conditions on the phase @xmath149 are not essential for the derivation of the semiclassical trace formula . \\n however , they are useful for the explicit evaluation of the coefficients @xmath150 , which we will that the condition ( [ orderk ] ) to order @xmath152 , respectively , can be fulfilled if the amplitudes @xmath47 are independent of @xmath53 . \\n this is due to the fact that the phase functions @ it will be convenient to use a more explicit representation of ( [ transvtilde ] ) , which can be obtained by introducing the notation @xmath230 and by noting that the differential operator in ( [ transvtilde ] ) can be written as transport equation ( [ dtranseq ] ) reads @xmath260 where @xmath261 denotes the classical hamiltonian for the spin degrees of freedom . \\n this equation can be integrated along the classical trajectories @xmath218 to @xmath294 can be written as @xmath295 . \\n\\nThe transport equation defined with the differential operator governs the dynamics and requires sections in the eigenbundle that are lifts of trajectories in phase space.

It is observed that the two approaches yield different results when extended', \"most semiclassical approaches to the dirac equation so far aimed at an extension of the wkb method , with the expectation that some kind of bohr - sommerfeld quantisation conditions would emerge in relativistic quantum mechanics . \\n the earliest such approach is due to pauli @xcite , who succeeded in showing that the phase of a wkb spinor is given by a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation for relativistic point particles . \\n but he could determine the amplitude of the semiclassical spinor only in some special cases . \\n although the programme mentioned above has been very successful in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , where it leads to the so - called einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) quantisation @xcite , establishing semiclassical quantisation conditions in the case of the dirac equation was found to be obstructed by the occurence of certain phases . \\n investigating multicomponent wave equations yabana and horiuchi @xcite noticed that geometric phases play an important rle in this context and have to be incorporated in appropriate quantisation conditions . using path integrals instead of the wkb method , kuratsuji and \\n iida @xcite realised that an inclusion of the geometric phases in the symplectic form on classical phase space offers a possibility to arrive at quantisation conditions . \\n a general theory of semiclassical quantisation for multicomponent wave equations in arbitrary dimensions , which derive from classical hamiltonian matrices with no globally degenerate eigenvalues , was developed by littlejohn and flynn @xcite . \\n this method , however , does not apply to the dirac hamiltonian since the eigenvalues of the associated classical hamiltonian matrix are twofold degenerate . \\n indeed , emmrich and weinstein @xcite found that in the degenerate case integrability of the corresponding classical dynamics is not a sufficiently strong condition to allow for an extension of ebk quantisation to the case of multicomponent wave equations . \\n moreover , even if successful , the procedure described above would not apply to systems whose classical limit is nonintegrable . in this paper \\n we will therefore follow an alternative approach in that we investigate the semiclassical time evolution and then derive a semiclassical trace formula . \\n this method is in the spirit of gutzwiller s semiclassical treatment of the schrdinger equation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the quantum mechanical density of states is set into relation to a sum over the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system . \\n the geometric phases mentioned above also appear in our approach in that they represent the spin transport along classical orbits in the trace formula . \\n the advantage of a trace formula approach is not only that it is applicable to both integrable and chaotic systems , but that it also provides the basis for efficient semiclassical quantisation conditions . in the context of quantum chaos extensive studies in this direction \\n have been undertaken , see e.  g.  @xcite . \\n furthermore , semiclassical trace formulae are the primary tools for a semiclassical theory of spectral statistics , see e.  g.   @xcite . \\n before we go into more detail we want to take the opportunity to clarify our point of view regarding the semiclassical limit on which we base the following investigations . in general we will consider the mathematical limit @xmath0 , with the understanding that in a given physical situation an equivalent limit in terms of physical quantities such as controlable external parameters has to be taken . \\n the effect of such a limit can then be expressed in terms of the spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian as follows . \\n the l.h.s .  of the trace formula that we are going to derive reads @xmath1 where the @xmath2 s are the quantum mechanical eigenvalues , which depend on @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes a variable parameter . \\n the smooth test function @xmath5 decreases faster than any power for large arguments so that the main contribution to the sum comes from eigenvalues within an interval of length proportinal to @xmath3 , @xmath6 in the formal limit @xmath0 the weyl law forces the spectral density to increase in such a way that , although the length of the interval ( [ sclimit ] ) shrinks to zero , infinitely many terms contribute to ( [ eq_lhs ] ) . \\n in other words , the semiclassical limit corresponds to the limit of an increasing spectral density . \\n the latter can possibly be achieved in a variety of different ways , which sometimes makes it necessary to vary several external parameters simultaneously . in case \\n the limit @xmath0 is accompanied by further limits , one then has to ensure that asymptotic expansions are uniform in the quantities that are involved in the further limits . throughout this paper \\n we will understand the semiclassical limit as being involved with the formal asymptotics as @xmath0 . in the last section , where we investigate the nonrelativistic approximation of the results obtained for the dirac equation \\n , we briefly discuss an example with a second , simultaneous limit .    in the following sections we will develop the steps that are necessary to derive a trace formula for the dirac equation in some detail . \\n basically we follow the method introduced by gutzwiller @xcite in the case of the schrdinger equation . \\n it turns out that regarding the translational degrees of freedom gutzwiller s approach can indeed be taken over . \\n the novel features that arise in the case of the dirac equation derive from the spin degrees of freedom and their coupling to the translational dynamics . in section [ sec2 ] \\n we first fix our notation and recall the basic properties of the dirac equation relevant for the following \\n . then we review the general rle of periodic orbits in semiclassical trace formulae and introduce a regularisation procedure ( cf . \\n @xcite ) which allows to obtain convergent trace formulae . \\n we moreover recall how to cut off the essential spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian , which is present in most physically relevant situations and typically covers @xmath7 \\\\cup [ mc^2,\\\\infty)$ ] . \\n section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the derivation of a semiclassical time evolution kernel in the spirit of the van vleck formula known for the respective kernel for the schrdinger equation . in the present context \\n we find it convenient to represent the time evolution kernel in terms of an oscillatory integral . \\n this method was developed for the study of scalar wave equations in the context of microlocal analysis , see e.  g.   @xcite , and subsequently found application to the development of several trace formulae @xcite . in the case of the schrdinger equation it leads to the same result as gutzwiller s original derivation @xcite which employed a stationary phase approximation of a feynman path integral . \\n the approach that we are going to follow is similar to the usual wkb method and results in equations that determine the coefficients of an @xmath3-expansion of the time evolution kernel . \\n the presence of spin is reflected in these equations through their matrix character . \\n to lowest order one obtains as a condition for their solvability two hamilton - jacobi equations , which correspond to the classical dynamics of relativistic point particles with positive and negative kinetic energy , respectively . the condition that arises in next - to - leading order in @xmath3 \\n is usually called transport equation . \\n the latter can be reduced to two differential equations for @xmath8 matrices describing the transport of the spin degrees of freedom along particle orbits . \\n the solutions of these spin transport equations as well as the solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equations finally determine the leading order of the semiclassical expansion for the time evolution operator . \\n it is remarkable that the classical hamiltonians do not include any term corresponding to forces acting on the magnetic moment of the spin . \\n this fact was already realised by pauli in his wkb treatment of the dirac equation , see also a related discussion in @xcite . \\n for this reason pauli s method was subsequently criticized by de  broglie @xcite , who argued that electromagnetic moments linked with the spin were classical quantities and therefore should be present in a semiclassical approximation . \\n this objection was later clarified by rubinow and keller @xcite . \\n they pointed out that the moments of an electron are proportional to @xmath3 so that in leading order as @xmath9 the influence of spin on the trajectories vanishes \\n . furthermore , they showed how to obtain the equation describing the thomas precession @xcite of a classical spin , which is also known as the bmt - equation @xcite , from the transport equation . \\n since it only contains the ratio of the magnetic moment and the spin , @xmath3 cancels from the equation of thomas precession which therefore provides the correct description of a classical spin .    in section [ sec4 ] \\n we analyse the spin transport in more detail , where we mainly focus on two aspects . \\n we first discuss the geometric terms that accompany semiclassical asymptotics of multicomponent wave equations as they follow from the transport equation . \\n their structure is of a similar form as discovered by littlejohn and flynn @xcite in the case of wave equations with classical hamiltonian matrices that have no ( globally ) degenerate eigenvalues . \\n in particular , one contribution is identified as being of the same type as the berry phase @xcite appearing in adiabatic approximations . \\n however , since in the case of the dirac equation the eigenvalues of the classical hamiltonian matrix are twofold degenerate , the u(1)-holonomy factors of littlejohn and flynn are replaced by corresponding su(2 ) terms . \\n our results are found to be in accordance with the general discussion of the transport equation for multicomponent wave equations by emmrich and weinstein @xcite . \\n in addition , these authors revealed the global geometric meaning of all terms that contribute to the total holonomy following from the transport equation . \\n as a second point we discuss how to express also the spin contributions to the semiclassical time evolution kernel in terms of classical quantities . to this end we introduce a classical spin vector @xmath10 as an expectation value of a time dependent spin operator . \\n it then follows from the spin transport equation that @xmath10 has to fulfill the classical equation of thomas precession . \\n thus , up to a phase factor the desired solution of the spin transport equation is determined by the classical spin precession along a given particle orbit . \\n we also show that the additional phase factor is composed of a dynamical part associated with the energy of a classical magnetic moment in given electromagnetic fields , and a geometric part which is of the type discovered by aharonov and anandan @xcite . \\n in section [ sec5 ] we derive the semiclassical trace formula for the dirac equation , which is our central result , by fourier transforming from the time domain to the energy domain and by subsequently taking the trace over spatial variables and matrix components . \\n the periodic orbits that enter the trace formula are determined by the relativistic dynamics of classical point particles without internal degrees of freedom . \\n the influence of the spin appears through two phase factors every periodic orbit is weighted by . \\n one of these phases measures the change in the direction of the classical spin after this has been transported along a periodic orbit , whereas the second one contains the phase described above as being composed of a dynamical and a geometric part . \\n finally , in section [ sec6 ] we consider the nonrelativistic limit of the results obtained in the previous sections . \\n it turns out that the leading order as @xmath11 coincides with the result of an application of the above programme to the pauli equation . \\n this equation is also of independent interest because in applications it is often used to investigate spin - orbit coupling . \\n based on the method developed in @xcite , this important effect is e.  g.  treated semiclassically in @xcite . \\n frisk and guhr @xcite introduced a trace formula for a nonrelativistic hamiltonian that describes spin - orbit coupling by modifying the berry - tabor trace formula @xcite for classically integrable systems without spin . to be able to use the formalism of @xcite they kept bohr s magneton \\n @xmath12 fixed as @xmath9 ; otherwise the corresponding classical hamiltonian matrix would have a twofold degenerate eigenvalue . \\n this procedure is in contrast to our method which allows to treat @xmath3 on the same footing in all terms . \\n fixing bohr s magneton can be regarded as simultanously performing the limit @xmath9 and the limit of an infinite coupling of spin to the translational degrees of freedom . in the semiclassical expressions \\n the spin precession then decouples adiabatically from the translational motion . \\n for the pauli equation that describes a coupling of spin to an external magnetic field we compare two ways of performing the semiclassical limit : ( i ) @xmath13 and ( ii ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 in the first case the nonrelativisitic limit of the result for the dirac equation emerges , where the geometric terms in the spin transport are su(2)-holonomy factors . in the second case the adiabatic decoupling of the spin motion results in geometric terms that yield a u(1 ) holonomy such that the berry phase of a precessing spin is recovered . both results being different implies that the semiclassical limit @xmath9 is not uniform in the magnetic field strength , a result that sheds some light on de  broglie s criticism of pauli s approach . \\n in this section we will present the basis for our subsequent discussion of semiclassical methods for the dirac equation . in the following our focus will be on relativistic particles of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 with spin 1/2 in external static electromagnetic fields . thus the relevant dirac equation reads @xmath18 with the quantum hamiltonian @xmath19 which is a matrix - valued differential operator of first order . here \\n @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the electromagnetic potentials such that the corresponding fields are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 . \\n the dirac algebra is realised by the @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath27 is the @xmath28 unit matrix ; see @xcite for further details . \\n the hamiltonian ( [ diracham ] ) can be realised as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the symbol matrix , in the sense of weyl quantisation , of the operator @xmath31 ( see e.  g. @xcite ) . in case the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfy suitable regularity conditions , the dirac hamiltonian @xmath31 , when defined on the domain @xmath32 in the hilbert space @xmath33 , is essentially self - adjoint ; see e.  g.  @xcite . in the following we will always deal with its self - adjoint extension which we also denote by @xmath31 . \\n solutions @xmath34 of the dirac equation ( [ diraceqn ] ) , with initial conditions @xmath35 , are obtained as @xmath36 . \\n the time evolution operator @xmath37 can then be represented by its schwartz kernel @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 this matrix - valued kernel is obviously required to solve the dirac equation , with initial condition @xmath40 our first major goal , to be dealt with in the next section , will be to derive a semiclassical representation of the time evolution kernel @xmath38 in the spirit of the van  vleck formula for the respective kernel of the schrdinger equation . in the latter case \\n such a representation is usually derived from a feynman path integral , to which the method of stationary phase is applied @xcite . \\n here we prefer an alternative semiclassical approach that makes use of a representation of the kernel in terms of an oscillatory integral . \\n this method has previously also proven useful in the case of the schrdinger equation , see e.  g.  @xcite , in which it served as a basis for a mathematically rigorous proof @xcite of the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite . \\n we therefore now introduce the matrix - valued oscillatory integral @xmath41 \\\\ {

next section . \\n here we only remark that the phase functions have to satisfy the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath48 with the classical hamiltonians @xmath49 of relativistic particles with positive @xmath50 and negative @xmath51 kinetic energies , respectively . as can readily be verified , the functions @xmath52 are the two , twofold degenerate , eigenvalues of the symbol matrix ( [ symbmat ] ) . \\n a posteriori , the occurrence of two hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjg ] ) justifies the choice ( [ oscillint ] ) of the oscillatory integral with two additive contributions .    due to the form ( [ hjg ] ) of the hamilton - jacobi equations and the initial conditions ( [ phiini ] ) , \\n the variable @xmath53 can be separated according to @xmath54 so that the functions @xmath55 also solve the hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjg ] ) , but with initial conditions @xmath56 . from general hamilton - jacobi theory , \\n see e.  g.   @xcite , it is known that therefore @xmath55 are generating functions for canonical transformations @xmath57 . \\n for ease of notation we restrict the following discussion to the index @xmath58 . \\n then @xmath59 are the end points of the solution @xmath60 of hamilton s equations of motion , generated by the hamiltonian @xmath61 , with initial condition @xmath62 . \\n this means that @xmath63 in order to explicitly incorporate the initial conditions we will also use the notation @xmath64 the fact that @xmath65 is a generating function for the associated canonical transformation moreover implies the relations @xmath66 for sufficiently small times , @xmath67 , the hamilton - jacobi equations ( [ hjg ] ) are known to possess unique solutions @xmath68 , see e.  g. @xcite . \\n however , it is well known that at some critical time @xmath69 a caustic may arise so that for @xmath70 the solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equations are no longer unique . \\n the representation ( [ oscillint ] ) of the time evolution kernel for @xmath70 can then only be a local one . \\n a global object has to be constructed by gluing appropriate local representations together . \\n this procedure requires consistency conditions , which are reflected by the presence of morse indices in the final semiclassical expression to be derived in section [ sec3 ] . \\n for the schrdinger equation this was already noticed by gutzwiller @xcite . a mathematically rigorous construction employing the maslov bundle can be found in @xcite . for simplicity \\n , we will neglect this problem below in that we continue to work with ( [ oscillint ] ) and only in the end introduce the appropriate phase factors . \\n since the principal applications of semiclassical trace formulae deal with eigenvalues of quantum hamiltonians , in particular with their semiclassical determination and their statistical properties , respectively , one would like to isolate the point spectrum of @xmath31 from its essential spectrum . in case \\n the potentials @xmath71 and @xmath21 vanish towards spatial infinity , or under suitably weakened conditions , the essential spectrum is known to be given by @xmath72 , see e.  g.   @xcite , so that for the following we assume @xmath31 to have , possibly infinitely many , eigenvalues of finite multiplicities in the interval @xmath73 . \\n given any interval @xmath74 that contains only isolated eigenvalues , we introduce a smooth function @xmath75 that is supported in @xmath76 , i.  e. , it vanishes outside of @xmath76 , such that @xmath77 on a suitably large subinterval . in particular , if there is no accumulation of eigenvalues at @xmath78 or @xmath79 , one can achieve that @xmath80 for all eigenvalues @xmath2 of @xmath31 . otherwise , as e.  g.   for the dirac hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom \\n , one can enlarge the support of @xmath81 arbitrarily towards @xmath82 so that arbitrarily many eigenvalues can be taken into account . then the operator @xmath83 , defined by the functional calculus given by the spectral theorem , is bounded and self - adjoint ; see e.  g.  @xcite for the scalar case . \\n this operator has a purely discrete spectrum with eigenvalues @xmath84 . \\n therefore the schwartz kernel @xmath85 of the truncated time evolution operator @xmath86 has a spectral representation @xmath87 in terms of the orthonormal eigenspinors @xmath88 of @xmath31 , where @xmath89 denotes the hermitian adjoint of @xmath88 . according to the definition of the truncated time evolution operator , which implies that @xmath90 the truncated kernel is obtained from the

\\n can identify the symbol of the operator @xmath83 to possess a semiclassical expansion with principal symbol ( leading term ) @xmath93 , see @xcite . \\n thus , an explicit calculation yields that @xmath94 for any sufficiently regular matrix - valued function @xmath95 and real - valued function @xmath96 . \\n this calculation is closely parallel to the respective result in the scalar case , which can be found in @xcite . \\n notice that in @xcite a different quantisation is used which , however , yields to lowest semiclassical order the same result as weyl quantisation . \\n thus , to

@xmath99 is smooth and compactly supported . \\n then in particular , both @xmath5 and @xmath100 are test functions from the schwartz space @xmath101 . \\n we now define the ( bounded ) operator

\\n we now evaluate the distribution @xmath108 $ ] on the test function @xmath113 and thus obtain the relation @xmath114 the semiclassical trace formula we are aiming at results , if for the truncated time evolution kernel in ( [ pretrace ] ) one introduces a semiclassical representation and calculates the integrals with the method of stationary phase . \\n the details of this procedure will be carried out in section [ sec5 ] . \\n here we only remark that upon introducing the representation ( [ kchismcl ] ) for the kernel , in leading semiclassical order one has to compute the integrals

[ genfct ] ) of the phase @xmath42 to the generating function @xmath120 , one obtains the equivalent conditions @xmath121 to be fulfilled by stationary points @xmath117 . \\n a comparison with the relations ( [ generfct ] ) now yields the conditions @xmath122 and @xmath123 , so that the stationary points determine periodic solutions , with energy @xmath4 , of hamilton s equations of motion generated by the hamiltonians ( [ classham ] ) . \\n we denote these periodic orbits by @xmath124 . \\n their periods , given by the @xmath125-components of the corresponding stationary points , are called @xmath126 . notice \\n that our requirement on the test function @xmath100 to have compact support implies that only periodic orbits up to some finite period , @xmath127 , contribute . \\n however , since the support of @xmath100 can be made arbitrarily large one can manage to include as many periodic orbits as desired . as our first observation on the way towards a semiclassical trace formula \\n we thus now conclude that , apart from terms of @xmath116 , in the semiclassical limit @xmath0 all contributions to the l.h.s .  of ( [ pretrace ] ) \\n are due to classical periodic orbits of energy @xmath4 of relativistic point particles \\n .    a further observation can be made with ( [ statphint ] ) if the set of stationary points @xmath117 divides into a sequence @xmath128 , @xmath129 , of @xmath130-dimensional smooth submanifolds of @xmath131 such that the phase @xmath132 is non - degenerate transversal to the manifolds @xmath128 . \\n the latter condition means that the matrix of second derivatives of the phase with respect to @xmath117 has constant rank @xmath133 when restricted to @xmath128 . \\n the flow generated by @xmath134 is then called clean , see @xcite for further details . \\n in this situation the set of periods is known to be discrete in @xmath135 @xcite . \\n thus the periods can not accumulate at some finite value @xmath136 . under these conditions \\n the method of stationary phase implies that each manifold @xmath128 yields a contribution @xmath137 to ( [ pretrace ] ) . here \\n @xmath138 is the action of any periodic orbit @xmath124 contained in @xmath128 , which can be computed as the integral of the canonical one - form @xmath139 along any closed path on @xmath128 . \\n the coefficients @xmath140 are independent of @xmath3 and arise in the method of stationary phase as certain integrals over @xmath128 . in the case of an isolated periodic orbit @xmath124 \\n the manifold @xmath128 is given by the points on the primitive periodic orbit associated with @xmath124 , and thus @xmath141 . \\n if the phase is non - degenerate transversal to an isolated periodic orbit , the latter is called non - degenerate . for this situation \\n we will explicitly calculate @xmath142 in section [ sec5 ] . \\n another case that can be dealt with explicitly concerns the hypersurfaces @xmath143 of constant energy @xmath4 in phase space . \\n the points @xmath144 are obviously periodic under the flows generated by @xmath134 , with trivial period @xmath145 . \\n since according to the above non - degeneracy condition we assume that @xmath146 are ( five dimensional ) smooth manifolds , @xmath4 is required to be a regular value for the respective flows . \\n moreover , the associated leading terms in ( [ genterm ] ) are of the order @xmath147 . \\n the explicit calculation of @xmath148 will also be performed in section [ sec5 ] . as a final remark \\n let us mention that in case the dynamics generated by @xmath134 are integrable , phase space foliates into three dimensional invariant tori such that the respective manifolds @xmath128 are given by the rational ones among these tori . \\n thus @xmath149 so that the leading terms in ( [ genterm ] ) are of the order @xmath150 . \\n in this section we will determine semiclassical representations for the time evolution kernel @xmath38 and its truncated version @xmath85 , respectively . \\n in a first step we derive necessary conditions that must be imposed on the matrix - valued amplitudes @xmath43 and on the real - valued phases @xmath42 in order that the oscillatory integral ( [ oscillint ] ) be a possible ansatz for the time evolution kernel . in a second step \\n we then employ the method of stationary phase to ( [ oscillint ] ) , and from the result we obtain a semiclassical expression in the spirit of the van  vleck formula for the respective kernel of the schrdinger equation .    the requirement \\n that ( [ oscillint ] ) , together with the expansion ( [ scamplitude ] ) , be a semiclassical representation of the kernel @xmath38 to all orders in @xmath3 means that the oscillatory integral shall fulfill the dirac equation ( [ diraceqn ] ) up to terms @xmath116 . \\n we therefore act with @xmath151 on ( [ oscillint ] ) after having introduced the expansion ( [ scamplitude ] ) , and then group terms of like orders in @xmath3 . \\n the phases @xmath42 and coefficients @xmath47 now have to satisfy equations that result from demanding that all coefficients of powers @xmath152 , @xmath153 , vanish . \\n to lowest order ( @xmath154 ) one thus obtains the equation @xmath155   a_0^+ ( { \\\\vec{x}},{\\\\vec{y}},t;{\\\\vec{\\\\xi } } ) \\\\\\\\ & \\\\hspace*{1cm}+{\\\\text{e}}^{\\\\frac{{\\\\text{i}}}{\\\\hbar}\\\\phi^- ( {

modify ( [ ksemicl ] ) to yield a semiclassical representation for the truncated time evolution kernel @xmath242 . according to ( [ kchismcl ] ) , to this end \\n one must apply the @xmath24 matrix @xmath243 to the ampliude @xmath244 . \\n since the spectral representation @xmath245 of the symbol matrix implies @xmath246 representing the amplitudes as in ( [ a0pm ] ) immediately shows that @xmath247 since therefore the matrix - valued amplitudes are only multiplied by a scalar factor , which is moreover constant along any classical trajectory @xmath218 , the only modification of ( [ ksemicl ] ) consists of an inclusion of the factors @xmath248 under the sums over the trajectories , where @xmath249 denotes the ( constant ) energy of @xmath218 . \\n the semiclassical representation for the time evolution kernel that was derived in the previous section is principally determined by the classical dynamics of relativistic point particles . \\n this is true to the extent that it essentially suffices to solve the equations of motion generated by the scalar hamiltonians @xmath134 . \\n indeed , the semiclassically dominating @xmath3-dependent phases occurring in ( [ ksemicl ] ) are completely fixed by hamilton s principal functions @xmath250 of the translational motion . \\n the latter decouples from the spin dynamics that , moreover , only contributes to the @xmath3-independent amplitudes in ( [ ksemicl ] ) .    in this section \\n we will investigate the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom more closely . \\n in particluar , we will interpret the su(2 ) matrix @xmath228 as a semiclassical time evolution operator for spin and , furthermore , relate it to a classical spin evolving according to a classical equation of motion . \\n in order to prepare for this , we first have to clarify the geometrical setting of spin transport along classical particle trajectories further . to this end \\n we consider the @xmath61-eigenbundle @xmath251 over phase space . \\n it is defined as the disjoint collection of the eigenspaces @xmath252 of the symbol matrix @xmath156 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath253 for each point @xmath59 in phase space . \\n since @xmath254 is hermitian , the decomposition of @xmath161 into the @xmath61- and @xmath255-eigenspaces is orthogonal with respect to the canonical scalar product . \\n this can hence be projected to the fibres @xmath256 , so that @xmath251 is a @xmath257 vector bundle with structure group u(2 ) . in terms of the orthonormal basis @xmath258 \\n used to define the matrix @xmath167 in ( [ vwdef ] ) , a section in the eigenbundle can be represented as @xmath259 to lowest semiclassical order the spin dynamics is governed by the transport equation defined with the differential operator ( [ trans1 ] ) . \\n this requires sections in the eigenbundle @xmath251 that are lifts of trajectories in phase space . \\n we therefore now consider the following differentiation on sections @xmath260 , which we evaluate at @xmath261 . \\n then @xmath262\\\\,v({\\\\vec{\\\\nabla}}_{{\\\\vec{x}}}s^+,{\\\\vec{x } } ) \\\\\\\\ & = &

section in @xmath251 in the above sense . according to ( [ trans1 ] ) and \\n ( [ trans1a ] ) an expansion of @xmath263 in the gliding basis @xmath264 yields the coefficients @xmath265   \\\\\\\\ &

to the definition of a covariant differentiation @xmath267 on the section @xmath268 , \\n @xmath269 if one now restricts the variable @xmath270 to the stationary points @xmath211 arising in ( [ statjdef ] ) , the first two terms in ( [ cddef ] ) again yield a differentiation along the trajectory @xmath271 associated with @xmath211 , compare ( [ dtranseq ] ) . \\n one then also recognizes @xmath200 as the su(2)-valued connection coefficient arising for the connection associated with @xmath267 . \\n a section @xmath268 given along a solution of the classical equations of motion is therefore parallel , if it is a solution of @xmath272 according to ( [ dtranseq ] ) such a solution can also be represented as @xmath273 thus , geometrically @xmath274 describes the parallel transport in @xmath251 defined by the connection arising from @xmath267 . along periodic orbits in phase space \\n , @xmath228 therefore yields the holonomy of this connection . \\n this geometric interpretation ensures that the combination @xmath275 , which appears in the semiclassical expression ( [ ksemicl ] ) for the time evolution kernel , is invariant under unitary base changes in @xmath251 . in physical terms \\n , @xmath228 can be interpreted as the semiclassical time evolution operator for two - spinors in the representation defined via the gliding basis @xmath264 . \\n the unitarity of @xmath228 then implies that the norm @xmath276 of the initial two - spinor @xmath277 is preserved under this evolution . in the following we will therefore always consider normalised sections @xmath268 in @xmath251 . \\n we would now like to compare the above construction with the connections that appear in the analysis of littlejohn and flynn @xcite , and emmrich and weinstein @xcite . \\n since the eigenbundle @xmath251 is a ( non - trivial ) subbundle of the trivial @xmath161 bundle over phase space , a natural connection in @xmath251 arises by projecting the trivial covariant differentiation of the @xmath161 bundle to @xmath251 . along a trajectory @xmath278 \\n this construction reads @xmath279 = : { { \\\\mathcal d}}^b u({\\\\vec{p}}(t),{\\\\vec{x}}(t))\\\\ , \\\\ ] ] when applied to a section @xmath268 in @xmath251 . in analogy to ( [ cddef ] ) one \\n then obtains a covariant differentiation in terms of the coefficients @xmath280 with respect to the gliding basis @xmath264 . \\n the connection coefficient @xmath281 that replaces @xmath200 can be calculated as @xmath282 } \\\\left [     ( {

that way one defines a connection on @xmath251 that bears some similarities to the adiabatic connection in quantum mechanics . \\n the latter has been identified by simon @xcite to produce the berry phase @xcite , see also @xcite . on this ground , littlejohn and \\n flynn @xcite introduced the notion of a berry term for the analogue to our @xmath283 in the case of principal symbol matrices with no globally degenerate eigenvalues . in the present context , the twofold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath61 forces @xmath283 to take values in su(2 ) , which hence leads to a connection with su(2 ) holonomy . \\n we emphasize , however , that no adiabatic approximation is made after one has arrived at the transport equations ( [ orderk ] ) and ( [ transvtilde ] ) , respectively . nevertheless , \\n following @xcite in spirit , we refer to @xmath283 as the su(2)-berry term , although regarding adiabatic approximations this notation is sligthly misleading . \\n the difference between the two covariant differentiations @xmath267 and @xmath284 can be expressed in terms of a connection coefficient @xmath285 . \\n this expression , which littlejohn and flynn @xcite refer to as the no - name term , has been identified by emmrich and weinstein @xcite to be related to the curvature associated with @xmath284 . \\n they moreover showed that @xmath286 where the poisson bracket for two matrix - valued functions @xmath287 on phase space is defined as @xmath288 notice that the ordering of the matrices is important . upon explicitly calculating the r.h.s .  of ( [ mcdef ] ) \\n one can verify that @xmath289 . \\n we now define a time - dependent spin operator @xmath290 , whose components act on @xmath257 , as @xmath291 so that @xmath292 . according to ( [ dtranseq ] ) , the dynamics of the spin operator @xmath290 \\n is governed by @xmath293 d_+ ( t)\\\\ .\\\\ ] ] introducing @xmath294 as in ( [ rdef ] ) , the evolution equation for @xmath295 can be brought into the convenient form @xmath296 which describes the precession of the vector @xmath295 about the instantaneous axis defined by @xmath297 . in order to obtain an object that can be considered as a classical spin , one introduces the expectation value of @xmath295 in a two - spinor state prescribed by @xmath277 , @xmath298 which obviously also solves ( [ sigevolve ] ) , i.  e. , @xmath299 where all quantities have to be taken along a given trajectory @xmath222 . \\n this classical equation is well known to describe the precession of a spinning particle in external electromagnetic fields @xmath300 and @xmath301 , as has already been demonstrated by thomas @xcite . \\n in @xcite it is rederived in a manifestly covariant formulation , and therefore also goes under the notion of bmt equation . in the present context , ( [ bmt ] ) can be viewed as a manifestation of the ehrenfest theorem for spin because here @xmath10 stands for any expectation value of the spin operator @xmath295 . \\n notice that since we deliberately omitted a factor of @xmath302 in the definition ( [ defsig ] ) of the spin operator , the classical spin vector @xmath10 is of ( constant ) unit length . \\n so far we have provided geometrical and physical interpretations of @xmath228 . yet , for the purpose of the semiclassical representation ( [ ksemicl ] ) of the time evolution kernel one needs to calculate the su(2 ) matrix latexmath:[\\\\[d_+ ( { \\\\vec{p}}(t),{\\\\vec{x}}(t ) ) = :   \\\\begin{pmatrix } { \\\\alpha}(t ) & -\\\\overline{{\\\\beta}}(t ) \\\\\\\\   { \\\\beta}(t ) & \\\\overline{{\\\\alpha}}(t ) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ , \\\\qquad    @xmath222 . \\n this can be achieved along the lines presented above , if one chooses the initial condition @xmath304 for a section @xmath268 solving @xmath305 . in the two - spinor representation for @xmath268 \\n this initial condition reads @xmath306 , and thus ( [ dholon ] ) implies that @xmath307 the spin expectation value @xmath308 corresponding to this choice then follows from ( [ spinex ] ) as @xmath309 mathematically , this physically motivated construction can be viewed as a map from @xmath274 to @xmath310 . \\n indeed , it is known as the hopf map @xmath311 , which yields a u(1 ) principal fibre bundle over @xmath312 .    in order to calculate @xmath313 for a given trajectory @xmath271 \\n one first has to integrate the evolution equation ( [ bmt ] ) for the precession of a classical spin along @xmath271 with initial condition @xmath314 . according to the relation @xmath315 one thus \\n has determined two of the three real degrees of freedom of @xmath313 by classical means . \\n the third degree of freedom can only be reconstructed , if one is able to lift the curve @xmath308 in @xmath312 to su(2 ) . to this end one \\n requires a connection on the u(1 ) bundle over @xmath312 that is provided by the hopf map . \\n the two degrees of freedom of the classical spin @xmath10 can be related to convenient coordinates on @xmath312 once one notices that the normalisation forces @xmath316 to range in the interval @xmath317 $ ] . \\n therefore , a variable @xmath318 $ ] can be introduced such that @xmath319 and @xmath320 one thus has three degrees of freedom at hand to describe @xmath228 . \\n a representation of the classical spin @xmath10 in terms of the variables @xmath321 then follows from ( [ spinexp ] ) , @xmath322 so that @xmath323 can be identified as the usual spherical coordinates on @xmath312 . in principle \\n , one could now choose @xmath324 as the additional spin degree of freedom discussed above . \\n however , in order to identify the connection on the hopf fibration it turns out that a choice of either @xmath325 or @xmath326 separately is more approppriate . since the north pole of @xmath312 corresponds to @xmath327 and the south pole to @xmath328 , the phase @xmath325 is ill - defined at the south pole , whereas @xmath326 is ill - defined at the north pole . following the procedure well known from the analysis of magnetic monopoles by wu and yang @xcite , we now choose @xmath325 as a fibre coordinate for base points on the northern hemisphere @xmath329 and , correspondingly , @xmath326 for base points on the southern hemisphere @xmath330 . \\n since the connection we want to identify is fixed by the requirement that the lifted curve on su(2 ) be the solution @xmath313 of ( [ dtranseq ] ) , an explicit expression for the connection coefficients can be derived from the equation @xmath331 that follows from the identification ( [ albeid ] ) . \\n multiplying this with @xmath332 from the left now yields @xmath333 exploiting ( [ thetadef ] ) and ( [ spheric ] ) then results in equations for @xmath325 on @xmath334 and @xmath326 on @xmath335 , respectively , @xmath336 according to the initial condition in ( [ spinexp ] ) the motion of the classical spin @xmath10 starts at the north pole so that for sufficiently small times @xmath337 \\n . thus the phase @xmath325 should be used , whose initial condition @xmath338 follows from ( [ d+init ] ) . \\n this allows an immediate integration of ( [ etadgl ] ) , @xmath339 the first term on the r.h.s .  of ( [ etaoft ] ) \\n is a dynamical phase associated with the classical energy of a magnetic moment in given electromagnetic fields , whereas the second term is a geometric phase . \\n the latter can be further characterised once one takes into account that @xmath325 is ill - defined at the south pole so that the phase @xmath340 should be used instead of @xmath325 as soon as @xmath10 enters @xmath335 , say , at a time @xmath341 . \\n one then has to integrate ( [ lambdadgl ] ) with initial condition @xmath342 . \\n to this end the one - form @xmath343 , which constitutes the geometric part of ( [ etaoft ] ) , has to be replaced by @xmath344 , see ( [ lambdadgl ] ) . \\n since these two expressions are the gauge potentials of a magnetic monopole , see @xcite , we can now formally identify the geometric part of ( [ etaoft ] ) to be caused by a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath345 situated at the origin of the sphere . \\n we again emphasize that in the above consideration no adiabaticity assumption was made . \\n therefore , although the result for the geometric phase is strikingly similar to the berry phase of a precessing quantum mechanical spin @xcite , the geometric part of @xmath325 is rather of the more general type discussed by aharonov and anandan @xcite . \\n having integrated the equations for the classical spin and for the additional phase , we are now able to present the su(2 ) matrix @xmath228 in the form @xmath346 where @xmath323 are spherical coordinates for @xmath308 , and @xmath325 is given by ( [ etaoft ] ) , if @xmath347 , and by @xmath348 , if @xmath349 . with this explicit formula for @xmath228 all terms entering the semiclassical propagator ( [ ksemicl ] ) to leading order in @xmath3 \\n are completely defined in terms of classical quantities . \\n after having obtained the fairly explicit expression ( [ ksemicl ] ) for the time evolution kernel together with an interpretation in terms of classical quantities , our ultimate goal now is to set up a semiclassical trace formula for the dirac equation . in the case of the schrdinger equation , \\n gutzwiller s original approach was to express the quantum mechanical density of states in terms of a sum over classical periodic orbits ( or , more generally , over connected manifolds of periodic points of the classical flow ) . \\n to this end he fourier - transformed the semiclassical expression for the retarded time evolution kernel , which he derived from its path integral representation , in order to obtain a semiclassical approximation for the green function . \\n subsequently he performed the trace integral with the method of stationary phase . \\n the result then immediately yielded the semiclassical spectral density , see @xcite for details . \\n since that way one has to deal with several singular objects , we here prefer to derive a regularised trace formula that only takes finite quantities into account . \\n the key relation for this procedure is equation ( [ pretrace ] ) , in which we below use a semiclassical representation for the truncated time evolution kernel @xmath85 . \\n we prefer this procedure , since first of all the energy localisation introduced through the truncation @xmath81 ensures that only the point spectrum of @xmath31 contributes . \\n secondly , the test function @xmath100 cuts off all periods of classical periodic orbits that exceed some maximal value @xmath350 , since we request @xmath100 to be compactly supported . \\n this cut - off prohibits any possible clash of the two non - commuting asymptotics @xmath0 and @xmath351 . \\n later @xmath100 can be chosen to have an arbitrarily large , though compact , support . \\n possibly , this support condition can be weakened by demanding a sufficiently strong decrease of @xmath352 as @xmath353 , see @xcite .    the semiclassical analysis presented at the end of section [ sec2 ] already revealed that , as @xmath0 , all contributions to ( [ pretrace ] ) which exceed @xmath116 have to derive from classical periodic orbits @xmath124 . \\n these are associated with the stationary points @xmath354 of the phase @xmath355 appearing in the integral ( [ statphint ] ) . \\n we also pointed out that the manifolds @xmath356 of stationary points @xmath357 are related to the hypersurfaces @xmath358 of constant energy , which are composed of periodic points with trivial periods @xmath145 . \\n we now assume the cleanness condition explained in section [ sec2 ] and recall that in particular this implies that all further stationary points are such that the periods @xmath126 do not accumulate at @xmath359 . \\n it is then possible to choose a smooth function @xmath360 whose ( connected ) support contains the period @xmath145 , but no further period @xmath361 . \\n we furthermore require @xmath362 to fulfill @xmath363 on some neighbourhood of @xmath145 . upon introducing the partition of unity @xmath364 $ ] under the integral ( [ pretrace ] ) , \\n the stationary points @xmath357 are separated from the further stationary points @xmath354 associated with the non - trivial periodic orbits @xmath124 . \\n these two classes of stationary points will contribute to ( [ pretrace ] ) in essentially different ways so that we will deal with them separately . \\n let our first concern hence be the calculation of the leading order contribution of the stationary points @xmath357 . \\n we therefore consider the integral @xmath365\\\\ { \\\\text{d}}t\\\\,{\\\\text{d}}^3\\\\xi\\\\,{\\\\text{d}}^3 x \\\\ . \\\\end{split}\\\\ ] ] since the cut - off function @xmath362 ensures that no stationary points with @xmath237 contribute , we expand the phases about @xmath205 . using the hamilton - jacobi equation for @xmath55 , one finds @xmath366        + \\\\frac{t^2}{2 } \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 s^\\\\pm}{\\\\partial t^2 }       ( { \\\\vec{x}},{\\\\vec{\\\\xi}},0 ) + o(t^3 ) \\\\\\\\    & = t \\\\left [ e - h^\\\\pm ( {

\\\\end{split}\\\\ ] ] at this stage we introduce in ( [ bigsing ] ) polar coordinates for the variable @xmath270 , i.  e. , @xmath367 with @xmath368 and solid angle @xmath369 . \\n this implies @xmath370 . \\n we then employ the method of stationary phase to the integration over the variables @xmath371 . \\n stationary points are therefore determined by a vanishing of the derivatives of ( [ phaseexp ] ) with respect to @xmath125 and @xmath326 , respectively . \\n evaluated at @xmath205 , the expression ( [ phaseexp ] ) shows that this yields the condition @xmath372 to be fulfilled by the stationary points @xmath373 . \\n therefore , our first conclusion is that the integral over the remaining variables @xmath374 is in fact restricted to the hypersurfaces @xmath375 and @xmath376 , respectively . carrying out the method of stationary phase further finally yields an asymptotic expansion of the integral ( [ bigsing ] ) as @xmath0 whose leading term can be determined explicitly in a straight forward manner , @xmath377 where @xmath378 denotes the volumes , @xmath379 of the hypersurfaces @xmath380 .    for the computation of the contribution to ( [ pretrace ] ) caused by the second class of stationary points , associated with the non - trivial classical periodic orbits , we proceed differently . \\n as a starting point we consider the r.h.s .  of ( [ pretrace ] ) , in which we introduce the semiclassical representation ( [ ksemicl ] ) of the truncated time evolution kernel . \\n that is , we are going to evaluate @xmath381\\\\ ,

with the method of stationary phase , after having inserted the r.h.s .   of ( [ ksemicl ] ) for @xmath382 . \\n notice that the factor @xmath383 cuts off a neighbourhood of @xmath205 and that the compactly supported function @xmath100 further restricts the range of integration over @xmath125 to a bounded set . \\n the semiclassical asymptotics ( [ ksemicl ] ) , which was derived with @xmath125 held fixed , can therefore be used in ( [ pocontrib ] ) without running into conflict with a need to perform @xmath351 . \\n apart from the factors caused by the spin degrees of freedom in ( [ ksemicl ] ) , and from the fact that the two relativistic classical hamiltonians @xmath158 determine the equations of motion for the translational degrees of freedom , the following calculation is closely parallel to the case of the schrdinger equation @xcite .    as implied by the discussion at the end of section [ sec2 ] , the stationary points relevant for the semiclassical evaluation of ( [

must coincide , so that these are indeed periodic . \\n the second condition then picks out those periodic orbits that are contained in the hypersurfaces @xmath358 . at stationary points \\n the phases then read @xmath387 in order to apply the method of stationary phase to ( [ ksemiinsert ] ) we assume that all periodic orbits are isolated and non - degenerate . strictly speaking , \\n one now has to introduce a partition of unity that separates the contributions of the isolated orbits . \\n since their periods are known not to accumulate at some finite value @xmath136 , this can be done in the same manner as for the trivial period @xmath145 above . \\n the only difference to the case of the schrdinger equation is caused by the presence of the spin degrees of freedom . \\n this is represented through the matrix trace under the integral in ( [ ksemiinsert ] ) . at stationary points , however , @xmath388 and the periodicity implies that @xmath389 . \\n thus a cyclic permutation under the matrix trace together with the former result ( [ d+result ] ) yields @xmath390 finishing the calculation as in the well known case of the schrdinger equation @xcite finally yields a contribution of @xmath391 for every isolated non - degenerate periodic orbit @xmath124 . here \\n the amplitude @xmath392 contains only classical information about the periodic orbit , including the contribution of a classical spin precessing along the orbit . \\n explicitly , the amplitude reads @xmath393 in this expression @xmath394 denotes the primitive period of @xmath124 , i.  e. , the period of the associated primitive periodic orbit . \\n moreover , @xmath395 is the linearised poincar map ( monodromy matrix ) along the orbit and @xmath396 is its maslov index .    from the gutzwiller trace formula \\n it is well known that if @xmath124 is not primitive , all quantities that enter ( [ pocont ] ) , apart from the spin contribution ( [ spincont ] ) , can be readily expressed in terms of the respective quantities of the associated primitive periodic orbit . in order to extend this to ( [ spincont ] ) \\n we recall that if @xmath124 is a @xmath188-fold repetition of a primitive orbit , where @xmath397 , the fact that @xmath398 is a holonomy implies that @xmath399 , where @xmath400 denotes the corresponding primitive holonomy . \\n according to @xcite the trace ( [ spincont ] ) associated with @xmath124 can hence be expressed as @xmath401 where @xmath402 is the @xmath188-th chebyshev polynomial of the second kind in @xmath403 . \\n thus , if desired , the following trace formulae ( [ semtf ] ) and ( [ denstf ] ) can also be expressed in terms of sums over primitive periodic orbits and their repetitions .    in case \\n the classical dynamics generated by the hamiltonians @xmath134 have only isolated non - degenerate periodic orbits , the relations ( [ weyl ] ) and ( [ pocont ] ) now enable us to state the following semiclassical trace formula explicitly , @xmath404 the conditions imposed on the test function @xmath5 and its fourier transform ensure that all expressions entering this trace formula are finite . \\n in particular , due to the compact support of @xmath100 the sum over periodic orbits only includes orbits up to a finite period and since the hamiltonian flow generated by @xmath52 was supposed to be clean the sum is of finite length . \\n often a semiclassical trace formula is presented for the spectral density of the quantum hamiltonian , see e.  g.  @xcite . \\n in the present case one can readily obtain such a trace formula for the truncated spectral density @xmath405 from ( [ semtf ] ) . \\n this reads @xmath406 obviously , the sum over classical periodic orbits in ( [ denstf ] ) does not converge . \\n this trace formula rather has to be viewed as a distributional identity whose actual meaning is provided by ( [ semtf ] ) . \\n as compared to the schrdinger equation , the dirac equation takes two generalisations into account . \\n it first takes care of the spin degrees of freedom and , secondly , describes relativistic dynamics . in many situations of physical interest \\n it , however , suffices only to include spin and to leave the description of the translational motion on a nonrelativistic level . \\n as it is well known , this can be achieved by considering the pauli equation , possibly with several additional terms such as one describing spin - orbit coupling . in this section \\n we therefore want to study particles of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 with spin 1/2 in a nonrelativistic context . to this end \\n we compare the semiclassical asymptotics for the pauli equation with the leading order as @xmath11 of the time evolution kernel ( [ ksemicl ] ) for the dirac equation . both approaches , which will turn out to produce identical results , then allow to set up a semiclassical trace formula . \\n we recall that when one divides a dirac four - spinor @xmath407 into two - spinors @xmath408 according to @xmath409 one obtains from ( [ diraceqn ] ) two coupled matrix differential equations . \\n it is well known @xcite that to leading order as @xmath410 these equations decouple , and that for @xmath411 the pauli equation @xmath412 \\\\psi({\\\\vec{x}},t )      = : \\\\hat{h}_p \\\\psi({\\\\vec{x}},t)\\\\ ] ] emerges . \\n see also @xcite for a careful treatment of the limit @xmath11 . \\n in weyl quantisation the pauli hamiltonian @xmath413 can be realised as @xmath414 with the @xmath8 symbol matrix @xmath415 as opposed to the dirac equation , compare ( [ symbmat ] ) , this weyl symbol is composed of a principal symbol @xmath416 { \\\\mathmybb{1}}_2 \\\\ , \\\\ ] ] which is a multiple of the identity matrix , and an additional subprincipal symbol @xmath417 that reflects a coupling of the spin degrees of freedom to the external magnetic field . \\n we are now going to study the semiclassical limit @xmath0 along the lines developed above for the dirac equation . \\n since therefore many details of the following calculations are similar to the ones shown in the previous sections , at several places the presentation will be kept rather brief . \\n the matrix - valued schwartz kernel @xmath418 of the time evolution operator @xmath419 obeys @xmath420 so that @xmath418 has to solve the pauli equation ( [ paulieqn ] ) with initial condition @xmath421 since the principal symbol @xmath422 is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix and thus has one eigenvalue , only one hamilton - jacobi equation will be relevant to the semiclassical time evolution . \\n we therefore choose the semiclassical ansatz @xmath423 \\\\ \\n ,     { \\\\text{d}}^3\\\\xi + o(\\\\hbar^{\\\\infty } ) \\\\ , \\\\ ] ] compare ( [ oscillint ] ) and ( [ genfct ] ) , which we introduce into ( [ paulieqn ] ) . comparing like orders in @xmath3 yields to lowest order a hamilton - jacobi equation for @xmath424 , whereas to orders @xmath152 , @xmath185 , transport equations for the @xmath8 matrices @xmath425 follow . \\n the initial conditions for @xmath426 and @xmath427 are analogous to ( [ phiini ] ) and ( [ ampini ] ) . by obvious reasons , \\n the subprincipal symbol ( [ subprinsymb ] ) can not appear to zeroth order in @xmath3 so that the hamilton - jacobi equation emerging in leading semiclassical order is only determined by the principal symbol @xmath428 . as a consequence , \\n the classical dynamics of the translational degrees of freedom are those of a nonrelativistic point particle that does not experience a force coming from a coupling of spin to the external magnetic field . \\n the latter is , however , contained in the transport equation for @xmath429 that appears in next - to - leading order . \\n this reads @xmath430            + { \\\\text{i}}m_p({\\\\vec{x } } ) \\\\right ] a_0 = 0 \\\\ , \\\\ ] ] so that the spin degrees of freedom enter through the traceless hermitian @xmath431 matrix @xmath432 in analogy to the considerations following ( [ a0sch ] ) , the ansatz @xmath433 for the lowest order amplitude , evaluated along a classical trajectory @xmath434 associated with the stationary point @xmath211 of the phase , proves useful . \\n it leads to the nonrelativistic spin transport equation @xmath435 d_p({\\\\vec{p}}(t),{\\\\vec{x}}(t ) )     = 0    \\\\ \\n , \\\\quad d_p({\\\\vec{p}}(0),{\\\\vec{x}}(0 ) ) = { \\\\mathmybb{1}}_2 \\\\ , \\\\ ] ] along @xmath434 that determines the su(2 ) matrix @xmath436 describing the leading contribution of spin to the semiclassical time evolution kernel . the transport equations ( [ paulitransp ] ) and ( [ dptransport ] ) \\n have already been obtained by choquard @xcite , who used a semiclassical ansatz similar to ( [ pauliscan ] ) , however , without the integration over @xmath270 . \\n we remark that the decomposition of the su(2 ) matrix @xmath228 into a classical spin @xmath10 and an additional phase @xmath325 presented in section [ sec4 ] can be repeated in the present , nonrelativistic , context . \\n this procedure leads to the dynamical equation @xmath437 for @xmath10 transported along @xmath434 in the external magnetic field . \\n the r.h.s .  of ( [ nonrelbmt ] ) can readily be identified as the leading order of the r.h.s . \\n of ( [ bmt ] ) as @xmath11 . \\n an additional phase , @xmath438 representing the third , nonclassical , degree of freedom of @xmath439 , appears in the same manner as for the dirac equation . this phase is again composed of a dynamical and a geometric part . \\n a calculation similar to that presented in section [ sec3 ] finally leads to the following semiclassical time evolution kernel for the pauli equation ( for @xmath237 ) , @xmath440 on the r.h.s . \\n the sum extends over the solutions of hamilton s equations of motion with the classical hamiltonian @xmath428 , which connect @xmath53 and @xmath92 in time @xmath125 . \\n the corresponding morse indices and hamilton s principal functions are denoted by @xmath441 and @xmath442 , respectively ; compare ( [ hamprifun ] ) . \\n the factor @xmath443 is defined by @xmath444 since these quantities are already determined by the nonrelativistic classical dynamics generated by @xmath422 , the only difference between ( [ kscpauli ] ) and the respective semiclassical kernel for the schrdinger equation is an appearence of the factors @xmath445 that represent the leading influence of spin . \\n so far we have examined the propagator that emerges from first taking the nonrelativistic limit of the dirac equation and then constructing a semiclassical time evolution kernel . \\n we will now compare this to the result that one obtains by first constructing the relativistic semiclassical kernel ( [ ksemicl ] ) and then taking the nonrelativistic limit . \\n we are thus now interested in the leading order behaviour of ( [ ksemicl ] ) as @xmath446 . to this end we first remark that @xmath447 i.  e. , in leading order the positive and negative kinetic energy parts in ( [ ksemicl ] ) decouple completely . \\n we therefore have to compare ( [ kscpauli ] ) with the upper left @xmath8 block of ( [ ksemicl ] ) . \\n this is consistent with ( [ d+pspinor ] ) because this block describes the time evolution of the two - spinor @xmath448 . \\n we furthermore recall the well known fact that the classical relativistic dynamics described by @xmath253 turns into the nonrelativistic dynamics with the classical hamiltonian @xmath428 as @xmath410 . \\n this in particular implies that @xmath449 , @xmath450 , @xmath451 and @xmath452 may in leading order be approximated by @xmath453 , @xmath454 , @xmath455 and @xmath456 . \\n we are therefore only left with comparing the factors @xmath228 and @xmath439 which describe the influence of spin in a relativistic and in a nonrelativistic context , respectively . \\n as already mentioned below equation ( [ nonrelbmt ] ) @xmath457 leads to a nonrelativistic approximation for both the classical spin dynamics and the nonclassical phase . \\n thus @xmath439 provides the leading order asymptotical term for @xmath228 as @xmath11 . collecting everything \\n one observes that in the nonrelativistic limit the upper left block of the semiclassical time evolution kernel ( [ ksemicl ] ) for the dirac equation turns into the respective result ( [ kscpauli ] ) for the pauli equation . in this sense \\n the limits @xmath0 and @xmath11 commute , at least concerning leading orders .    in order to set up a semiclassical trace formula for the pauli hamiltonian \\n we now assume that @xmath458 has a pure point spectrum . \\n otherwise we would have to employ an energy localisation to a gap in the essential spectrum as described in section [ sec2 ] for the dirac hamiltonian . \\n we then consider a test function @xmath459 with compactly supported fourier transform @xmath100 . applying the procedure of section [ sec5 ] to @xmath458 finally yields @xmath460 where the sum extends over the periodic orbits of the classical dynamics generated by the principal symbol @xmath422 . \\n in fact , all classical quantities entering ( [ paulitf ] ) refer to this hamiltonian . \\n as explained in the relativistic case , for such a trace formula to be valid the flow generated by @xmath422 must be clean . \\n the amplitude associated with each isolated , non - degenerate periodic orbit then reads @xmath461 a different semiclassical approach to the pauli equation has previously been used to investigate spin - orbit coupling @xcite . \\n the authors of these papers principally base their method on the technique developed by littlejohn and flynn @xcite to treat matrix - valued wave operators with principal symbols that have no ( globally ) degenerate eigenvalues . \\n below we will derive the time evolution according to the prescription of the semiclassical limit employed in @xcite , however , using the techniques outlined in the previous sections . \\n for simplicity , and for ease of comparison with our previous semiclassical study of the pauli equation , we will not consider spin - orbit coupling but only a coupling of spin to the external magnetic field . \\n therefore , the relevant hamiltonian is the one defined in ( [ paulieqn ] ) . \\n however , a generalisation of the following discussion to arbitrary couplings of the form @xmath462 is straight forward . \\n following now the philosophy of @xcite , we introduce bohr s magneton @xmath463 and consider it as constant in the semiclassical limit . \\n thus the hamiltonian @xmath464 arises as a weyl operator associated with the symbol @xmath465 so that no subprincipal symbol occurs . as opposed to the situation analysed at the beginning of this section \\n , one could view the present procedure as taking the simultaneous limits @xmath0 and @xmath466 in such a way that @xmath467 . \\n another way to look at this is to keep @xmath468 fixed , but to perform the limit of ` large spin ' . \\n as long as @xmath469 the @xmath8 symbol matrix ( [ modsymb ] ) has two non - degenerate eigenvalues @xmath470 which generate two classes of classical dynamics . \\n since this is similar to the situation occurring for the dirac equation , the semiclassical ansatz for the time evolution kernel @xmath471 therefore should be chosen as in ( [ oscillint ] ) , but where now the amplitudes are @xmath8 matrices . applying \\n the procedure described in section [ sec3 ] then leads to two hamilton - jacobi equations , with the two hamiltonians ( [ modham ] ) . \\n the non - scalar contribution to the symbol matrix ( [ modsymb ] ) is given by the hamiltonian @xmath472 describing a quantum mechanical precessing spin . \\n the orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath473 of @xmath474 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath475 are hence well known from the standard example of the berry phase @xcite . in analogy to ( [ a0pm ] ) \\n one can now introduce the ansatz @xmath476 with some suitable vector @xmath477 . upon multiplication of the transport equation for @xmath194 with @xmath478 from the left one \\n obtains the equation @xmath479            + { \\\\text{i}}{m'}_p^+ ( { \\\\vec{\\\\nabla}}_{{\\\\vec{x}}}s^+,{\\\\vec{x } } ) \\\\right ]            \\\\tilde v^\\\\dagger = 0 \\\\ , \\\\ ] ] where @xmath480 on the r.h.s . , the factor @xmath481 is the well known expression for the adiabatic connection leading to the u(1)-berry phase of a precessing spin @xcite . \\n again , the transport equations for @xmath159 will be solved along the classical trajectories @xmath482 following from the hamiltonians ( [ modham ] ) . as suggested by ( [ d+def ] ) and ( [ d+def ] ) , one separates @xmath483 so that along a trajectory @xmath484 the phase @xmath485 has to solve the equation @xmath486 { d'}_+(t ) = 0\\\\ ,   \\\\qquad { d'}_+(0 ) = 1 \\\\ .\\\\ ] ] as a result , one obtains the well known u(1)-berry phase of a quantum mechanical spin that has been transported adiabatically along the trajectory @xmath484 . \\n finally , the semiclassical time evolution kernel reads @xmath487 where all classical quantities refer to the dynamics generated by the hamiltonians ( [ modham ] ) and are defined in analogy to the previous cases . \\n in particular , hamilton s principal functions @xmath488 are related to the analogous quantities @xmath489 that are defined by the hamiltonian ( [ prinsymb ] ) , but here evaluated along the trajectories @xmath490 , through @xmath491 due to the factors @xmath492 in ( [ kpmod ] ) the ` spin up ' and ` spin down ' components of an initial spinor @xmath493 are propagated independently along the corresponding trajectories following from the hamiltonians @xmath494 . here ` spin up ' and ` spin down ' are defined with respect to the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field . \\n this procedure breaks down at mode conversion points , i.  e. , at points where the magnetic field vanishes . \\n there the symbol matrix ( [ modsymb ] ) has one twofold degenerate eigenvalue and the level surfaces of the two hamiltonians @xmath494 cross . \\n moreover , since @xmath495 develops a singularity , the classical trajectories are not smooth when crossing a mode conversion point . in certain situations \\n this defect can be cured by letting the trajectories cross the two level surfaces , see @xcite , but in general an application of the present semiclassical procedure requires a more refined treatment of mode conversion points , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .    at this place \\n one could easily establish the corresponding semiclassical trace formula , if one followed the programme outlined in section [ sec2 ] once again . \\n however , we refrain from doing this here and rather comment on the relation between the two semiclassical approaches to the pauli equation discussed in this chapter , which lead to the two distinct expressions ( [ kscpauli ] ) and ( [ kpmod ] ) for the time evolution kernel . in the first scenario we systematically performed an expansion in @xmath3 and determined the leading order terms for the time evolution kernel and for the classical side of the trace formula . \\n we observed that to lowest order the translational degrees of freedom decouple from the spin degrees of freedom in that the translational motion experiences no back reaction from the coupling of spin to the external magnetic field . in a certain sense \\n this decoupling can be seen as an adiabatic one where the translational motion is considered as slow , although this condition is not needed for the formulae to be valid . \\n this topic was also discussed by balian and bloch @xcite in the context of semiclassical approximations for the green function . \\n spin enters in next - to - leading order and , among other quantities , determines the amplitudes in the relevant semiclassical expressions . \\n the leading order of the spin dynamics is given by that of a classical spin precessing along the particle trajectories . \\n we have repeatedly emphasized that at this stage no adiabatic limit is considered . \\n in addition , a geometric phase of the type discussed by aharonov and anandan @xcite enters the amplitudes . in the second scenario we considered the double limit @xmath0 , @xmath496 , @xmath467 . \\n it turned out that in this context the relevant classical translational motion follows from two hamiltonians , taking the effect of a coupling of a ` spin up ' and a ` spin down ' , respectively , to the external magnetic field into account . since in this context , via the expressions @xmath497 in ( [ kpmod ] ) , the spin direction is defined with respect to the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field , the spin degrees of freedom are transported adiabatically along the particle trajectories . \\n there is no further dynamical equation for a classical spin and , as a consequence of the limit @xmath496 , the berry phase that enters can be viewed as emerging from an adiabatic approximation of the geometric term found in the first scenario . \\n this finding is in agreement with the remark on the relation of these phases that can be found in @xcite . in order to be more specific concerning the issue of adiabaticity , we introduce spherical coordinates @xmath498 for @xmath499 which allows to obtain an explicit expression for the berry phase emerging from ( [ berryph ] ) . \\n moreover , we reintroduce @xmath500 for the magneton @xmath501 . using ( [ randr ] ) \\n one thus observes that @xmath502 which can be introduced in ( [ kpmod ] ) . \\n the first factor on the r.h.s . \\n is readily identified to arise as an adiabatic approximation to @xmath503 , if the phase ( [ etaoftnr ] ) is evaluated along the trajectory @xmath484 instead of @xmath434 . \\n thus the spin contributions to ( [ kpmod ] ) are adiabatic approximations to the respective contributions to ( [ kscpauli ] ) . \\n conversely , one concludes that in the semiclassical time evolution according to ( [ kscpauli ] ) the spin transport is performed non - adiabatically so that mode conversion poses no difficulty . in conclusion , one can consider the two alternative ways of performing the semiclassical limit as being considered with a ` weak ' and a ` strong ' coupling , respectively , of spin to the translational degrees of freedom . \\n comparing the two results ( [ kscpauli ] ) and ( [ kpmod ] ) for the time evolution kernel one notices that the two approaches yield different results when extended to intermediate couplings . in the first case the translational motion \\n is not influenced by the spin , whose dynamics in turn is not treated adiabatically . in the second case , however , spin has an effect on the translational motion , but the spin dynamics enters in an adiabatic approximation . \\n this observation illustrates the fact that the @xmath3-expansions employed are not uniform in the field strength .\", 'we derive a semiclassical time evolution kernel and a trace formula for the dirac equation . \\n the classical trajectories that enter the expressions are determined by the dynamics of relativistic point particles . \\n we carefully investigate the transport of the spin degrees of freedom along the trajectories which can be understood geometrically as parallel transport in a vector bundle with su(2 ) holonomy . \\n furthermore , we give an interpretation in terms of a classical spin vector that is transported along the trajectories and whose dynamics , dictated by the equation of thomas precession , gives rise to dynamical and geometric phases every orbit is weighted by . \\n we also present an analogous approach to the pauli equation which we analyse in two different limits . \\n ulm - tp/98 - 6 + november 1998 +    * a
