median , 1.6 g / dl ) . our study , \\n however , is peculiar in using iron therapy in a non - iron - deficiency state.28 iron overload after iv iron therapy , with potential concerns about the risk of developing secondary cancers and infection , might be raised . \\n the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least 9 weeks of iv iron therapy was 1,170 ng / ml . most of the literature addressing cancer and infections in iron - overloaded patients comes from patients with hemochromatosis or patients who are undergoing hemodialysis . \\n published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well - supported.30 in fact , anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58,000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1,200 ng / ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern , which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . to further address many of the questions raised , \\n our team is planning a bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial . \\n in addition , we will be looking into predictors of response to iv iron , such as serum hepcidin level . \\n iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy . \\n further randomized trials are needed to address many of the questions raised in our pilot study .', 'abstract': 'backgroundanemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing active therapy is commonly encountered and may worsen quality of life in these patients . the effect of blood transfusion is often temporary and may be associated with serious adverse events . \\n erythropoiesis - stimulating agents are not effective in 30%50% of patients and may have a negative effect on overall survival.aimsto assess the efficacy and feasibility of intravenous iron therapy in patients with cancer who have non - iron - deficiency anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy without the use of erythropoiesis - stimulating agents.methodsadult patients with solid cancers and non - iron - deficiency anemia were included . \\n ferric sucrose at a dose of 200 mg was given in short intravenous infusions weekly for a total of 12 weeks . \\n hemoglobin level was measured at baseline , every 3 weeks , and 2 weeks after the last iron infusion ( week 14 ) . \\n adverse events related to intravenous iron were prospectively reported.resultsof 25 patients included , 19 ( 76.0% ) completed at least three iron infusions and 14 ( 56.0% ) finished the planned 12 weeks of therapy . \\n the mean hemoglobin level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ;

state meson . in these decays , strong interaction effects can be parametrized by a single quantity , @xmath13 , the pseudoscalar meson decay constant . \\n the leptonic decay rate can be measured by experiment , and the decay constant can be determined by the equation ( ignoring radiative corrections ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath16 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite element , @xmath17 is the mass of the meson , and @xmath18 is the mass of the charged lepton . \\n the quantity @xmath13 describes the amplitude for the @xmath19 and @xmath20-quarks within the @xmath21 to have zero separation , a condition necessary for them to annihilate into the virtual @xmath22 boson that produces the @xmath12 pair . \\n the experimental determination of decay constants is one of the most important tests of calculations involving nonperturbative qcd . \\n such calculations have been performed using various models  @xcite or using lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . \\n the latter is now generally considered to be the most reliable way to calculate the quantity . \\n knowledge of decay constants is important for describing several key processes , such as @xmath23 mixing , which depends on @xmath24 , a quantity that is also predicted by lqcd calculations . \\n experimental determination  @xcite of @xmath24 with the leptonic decay of a @xmath25 meson is , however , very limited as the rate is highly suppressed due to the smallness of the magnitude of the relevant ckm matrix element @xmath26 . \\n the charm mesons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are better instruments to study the leptonic decays of heavy mesons since these decays are either less ckm suppressed or favored , _ \\n i.e. _ , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are much larger than @xmath31 . \\n thus , the decay constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 determined from charm meson decays can be used to test and validate the necessary lqcd calculations applicable to the @xmath34-meson sector .    among \\n the leptonic decays in the charm - quark sector , @xmath35 decays are more accessible since they are ckm favored . \\n furthermore , the large mass of the @xmath11 lepton removes the helicity suppression that is present in the decays to lighter leptons . \\n the existence of multiple neutrinos in the final state , however , makes measurement of this decay challenging . \\n physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) might also affect leptonic decays of charmed mesons . \\n depending on the non - sm features , the ratio of @xmath36 could be affected  @xcite , as could the ratio  @xcite @xmath37 . \\n any of the individual widths might be increased or decreased . \\n there is an indication of a discrepancy between the experimental determinations  @xcite of @xmath33 and the most recent precision lqcd calculation  @xcite . \\n this disagreement is particularly puzzling since the cleo - c determination  @xcite of @xmath32 agrees well with the lqcd calculation  @xcite of that quantity . some  @xcite conjecture that this discrepancy may be explained by a charged higgs boson or a leptoquark .    in this article \\n , we report an improved measurement of the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay @xmath0 ( charge - conjugate modes are implied ) , with @xmath1 , from which we determine the decay constant @xmath33 . \\n we use a data sample of @xmath38 events provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and collected by the cleo - c detector at the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath39 mev , near @xmath3 peak production  @xcite . \\n the data sample consists of an integrated luminosity of @xmath40 @xmath41 containing @xmath42 @xmath3 pairs . \\n we have previously reported  @xcite measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath0 with a subsample of these data . a companion article  @xcite reports measurements of @xmath33 from @xmath43 and @xmath0 , with @xmath44 , using essentially the same data sample as the one used in this measurement . \\n the cleo - c detector  @xcite is a general - purpose solenoidal detector with four concentric components utilized in this measurement : a small - radius six - layer stereo wire drift chamber , a 47-layer main drift chamber , a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and an electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 7800 csi(tl ) crystals . \\n the two drift chambers operate in a @xmath45  t magnetic field and provide charged particle tracking in a solid angle of @xmath46% of @xmath47 . \\n the chambers achieve a momentum resolution of @xmath48% at @xmath49  gev/@xmath50 . \\n the main drift chamber also provides specific - ionization ( @xmath51 ) measurements that discriminate between charged pions and kaons . \\n the rich detector covers approximately @xmath52% of @xmath47 and provides additional separation of pions and kaons at high momentum . \\n the photon energy resolution of the calorimeter is @xmath53% at @xmath54  gev and @xmath55% at @xmath56  mev . \\n electron identification is based on a likelihood variable that combines the information from the rich detector , @xmath51 , and the ratio of electromagnetic shower energy to track momentum ( @xmath57 ) . \\n we use a geant - based  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation program to study efficiency of signal - event selection and background processes . \\n physics events are generated by evtgen  @xcite , tuned with much improved knowledge of charm decays  @xcite , and final - state radiation ( fsr ) is modeled by the photos  @xcite program . \\n the modeling of initial - state radiation ( isr ) is based on cross sections for @xmath3 production at lower energies obtained from the cleo - c energy scan  @xcite near the cm energy where we collect the sample . \\n the presence of two @xmath58 mesons in a @xmath3 event allows us to define a single - tag ( st ) sample in which a @xmath58 is reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and a further double - tagged ( dt ) subsample in which an additional @xmath59 is required as a signature of @xmath60 decay , the @xmath59 being the daughter of the @xmath60 . \\n the @xmath61 reconstructed in the st sample can be either primary or secondary from @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) . \\n the st yield can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the produced number of @xmath3 pairs , @xmath66 is the branching fraction of hadronic modes used in the st sample , and @xmath67 is the st efficiency . \\n the @xmath68 counts the candidates , not events , and the factor of 2 comes from the sum of @xmath28 and @xmath61 tags . \\n our double - tag ( dt ) sample is formed from events with only a single charged track , identified as an @xmath69 , in addition to a st . \\n the yield can be expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the leptonic decay branching fraction , including the subbranching fraction of @xmath1 decay , @xmath72 is the efficiency of finding the st and the leptonic decay in the same event . from the st and dt yields we can obtain an absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay @xmath71 , without needing to know the integrated luminosity or the produced number of @xmath3 pairs , @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is the effective signal efficiency . because of the large solid angle acceptance with high segmentation of the cleo - c detector and the low multiplicity of the events with which we are concerned , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the leptonic decay efficiency . \\n hence , the ratio @xmath78 is insensitive to most systematic effects associated with the st , and the signal branching fraction @xmath71 obtained using this procedure is nearly independent of the efficiency of the tagging mode .      to minimize systematic uncertainties , we tag using three two - body hadronic decay modes with only charged particles in the final state . \\n the three st modes and @xmath79 are shorthand labels for @xmath80 events within mass windows ( described below ) of the @xmath81 peak in @xmath82 and the @xmath83 peak in @xmath84 , respectively . \\n no attempt is made to separate these resonance components in the @xmath85 dalitz plot . ] \\n are @xmath86 , @xmath79 , and @xmath87 . \\n using these tag modes also helps to reduce the tag bias which would be caused by the correlation between the tag side and the signal side reconstruction if tag modes with high multiplicity and large background were used . \\n the effect of the tag bias @xmath88 can be expressed in terms of the signal efficiency @xmath74 defined by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the st efficiency when the recoiling system is the signal leptonic decay with single @xmath59 in the other side of the tag . \\n as the general st efficiency @xmath67 , when the recoiling system is any possible @xmath91 decays , will be lower than the @xmath90 , sizable tag bias could be introduced if the multiplicity of the tag mode were high , or the tag mode were to include neutral particles in the final state . as shown in sec . \\n [ sec : results ] , this effect is negligible in our chosen clean tag modes . \\n the @xmath92 decay is reconstructed by combining oppositely charged tracks that originate from a common vertex and that have an invariant mass within @xmath93 mev of the nominal mass  @xcite . \\n we require the resonance decay to satisfy the following mass windows around the nominal masses  @xcite : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 mev ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 mev ) . \\n we require the momenta of charged particles to be @xmath56 mev or greater to suppress the slow pion background from @xmath98 decays ( through @xmath99 ) . \\n we identify a st by using the invariant mass of the tag @xmath100 and recoil mass against the tag @xmath101 . \\n the recoil mass is defined as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the net four - momentum of the @xmath4 beam , taking the finite beam crossing angle into account ; @xmath104 is the four - momentum of the tag , with @xmath105 computed from @xmath106 and the nominal mass  @xcite of the @xmath91 meson . \\n we require the recoil mass to be within @xmath107 mev of the @xmath108 mass  @xcite . \\n this loose window allows both primary and secondary @xmath91 tags to be selected .        to estimate the backgrounds in our st and dt yields from the wrong tag combinations ( incorrect combinations that , by chance , lie within the @xmath109 signal region ) , we use the tag invariant mass sidebands . \\n we define the signal region as @xmath110 mev @xmath111 mev , and the sideband regions as @xmath112 mev @xmath113 mev or @xmath114 mev @xmath115 mev , where @xmath116 is the difference between the tag mass and the nominal mass . \\n we fit the st @xmath109 distributions to the sum of double - gaussian signal function plus second - degree chebyshev polynomial background function to get the tag mass sideband scaling factor . \\n the invariant mass distributions of tag candidates for each tag mode are shown in fig . \\n [ fig : dm ] and the st yield and @xmath109 sideband scaling factor are summarized in table  [ table : data - single ] . \\n we find @xmath117 summed over the three tag modes . \\n .[table : data - single ] summary of single - tag ( st ) yields , where @xmath118 is the yield in the st mass signal region , @xmath119 is the yield in the sideband region , @xmath120 is the sideband scaling factor , and @xmath68 is the scaled sideband - subtracted yield . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we considered six semileptonic decays , @xmath121 @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , as the major sources of background in the @xmath128 signal region . \\n the second dominates the nonpeaking background , and the fourth ( with @xmath129 ) dominates the peaking background . \\n uncertainty in the signal yield due to nonpeaking background ( @xmath130 ) is assessed by varying the semileptonic decay branching fractions by the precision with which they are known  @xcite . \\n imperfect knowledge of @xmath131 gives rise to a systematic uncertainty in our estimate of the amount of peaking background in the signal region , which has an effect on our branching fraction measurement of @xmath132 . \\n we study differences in efficiency , data vs mc events , due to the extra energy requirement , extra track veto , and @xmath133 requirement , by using samples from data and mc events , in which _ both _ the @xmath134 and @xmath2 satisfy our tag requirements , i.e. , `` double -

[ intense ] show that the intensity changed due to a factor.the same , we can get @xmath17 where @xmath18is the flux striking the disc in kerr metric , while@xmath19is the fomat in newtonian space - time . in the newtonian space-time.in the model of point like , static source up the black hole \\n , the flux striking the disk should be @xmath20 in kerr black hole , we know that @xmath21 we set r , a , in unit of m , then@xmath19can have the detailed formula @xmath22 for a non - rotating black hole , we can get @xmath23 when we set r , h in unit of schwichild radii @xmath24,the formula change to @xmath25 from eq . \\n [ qin ] we can see that the flux striking the accretion disc has a close relation with both the photo index @xmath0 , the accretion rate @xmath26,and the sources location.observations shows that the source x - ray continuum always have a photo index @xmath27 . \\n when we compute the @xmath18 in this model , we find that in a extremely rotating kerr metric the flux concentrated on only a very small region near the center , while other place left nearly no illumination at all.it is apparently a gr effect.when it comes to the schwchild metric , the power law approximation is also not good to describe the emissivity , but it is rather flatter to the case in kerr metric.we can conclude that the need of steep power law model may due to a rapidly rotating black hole . \\n our work is invoked by recent report of steep emissity in inner part of accretion disk(fabian 2002).in the observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15,fabian use a broken emissivity law to model the data , and with good result.however,they assume that the steep emissivity is a result from two reflector in the disk . in our work \\n we can see that , the steep emissivity may come from the effect of light bending near the center black hole.and the concentrating of flux , will give inner side a rather high ionization parameter,@xmath28 , which may result a line component at @xmath29kev.there are also other sources , such as iras 13224 - 3809(boller 2003),which should induce a steeper emissivity law.the steep emissivity law may be a evidence of a centering rapidly rotating black hole .    in present x - ray study , \\n there are lots of uncertainty in modelling the iron lines in agn , the s / n is a big problem to determine the real shape of the line.former observation confirms that there exist many agn which contain board and skew iron line , indicating that the line is produced very near the black hole.however,recent xmm observation show that there does not ubiquitous exist board iron line , instead , a narrow cole at 6.4 kev is present.this has not been included in this paper .    our work show that in the gr effect , the emissity can not be simply regarded as a power law as a function of r , instead , it should be described by various factors such as a , the source s position the photo index.when computed in the gr we find in the kerr metric the large concentration of the flux in the accretion disc , rather left other part of the disk `` empty'',also , the large concentration in flux will undoubtedly invoke the model of ionized disk describe by ross 1999.and our work is only a simplified model to test the gr effects , further work such as the disk motion and density under high illumination which may affect the emissity should be invoked . \\n ballantyne d.r . \\n , fabian a.c . , 2001 , mnras , 328 , l11 ballantyne d.r . , \\n ross r.r , 2002 , mnras , in press ( astro -
